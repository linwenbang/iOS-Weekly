 Hey everyone.</span></span>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="27.0" data-end="28.0"> 
Welcome to our session on what's </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="28.0" data-end="30.0"> 
new in App Store Connect? </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="30.0" data-end="31.0"> 
My name is Daniel Miao.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="31.0" data-end="33.0"> 
And I'm an engineering manager </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="33.0" data-end="35.0"> 
on the App Store Connect team.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="35.0" data-end="37.0"> 
So what's new? </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="37.0" data-end="39.0"> 
Well, first off, you may have </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="39.0" data-end="40.0"> 
noticed we changed our name.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="42.0" data-end="45.0"> 
This is really just a small part </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="46.0" data-end="47.0"> 
of our ongoing commitment to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="47.0" data-end="48.0"> 
building the best tools and </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="48.0" data-end="50.0"> 
services focused on you, our </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="51.0" data-end="53.0"> 
developers building apps for the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="53.0" data-end="53.0"> 
App Store.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="54.0" data-end="56.0"> 
Now along these lines, we've </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="56.0" data-end="58.0"> 
also been undergoing a few </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="58.0" data-end="60.0"> 
renovations on our App Store.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="62.0" data-end="64.0"> 
So last year, we went back and </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="64.0" data-end="66.0"> 
we redesigned the iOS App Store.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="67.0" data-end="69.0"> 
And following the success of </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="69.0" data-end="72.0"> 
that redesign, this year we also </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="72.0" data-end="74.0"> 
redesigned the Mac App Store.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="76.0" data-end="77.0"> 
Now with this Mac App Store </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="77.0" data-end="79.0"> 
redesign, we've added support </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="79.0" data-end="82.0"> 
for a few new features including </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="82.0" data-end="84.0"> 
app subtitles and app previews.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="85.0" data-end="86.0"> 
You can take advantage of these </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="86.0" data-end="88.0"> 
features by signing into App </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="88.0" data-end="90.0"> 
Store Connect or by using the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="90.0" data-end="91.0"> 
XML feed if you use that for </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="91.0" data-end="92.0"> 
automation today.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="93.0" data-end="97.0"> 
Now for today's session, we're </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="97.0" data-end="100.0"> 
going to focus on enhancements </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="100.0" data-end="102.0"> 
we've made to App Store Connect.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="102.0" data-end="103.0"> 
And we're going to talk about it </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="103.0" data-end="105.0"> 
within the context of your app </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="105.0" data-end="106.0"> 
lifecycle.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="106.0" data-end="109.0"> 
This lifecycle typically begins </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="109.0" data-end="110.0"> 
with the design phase.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="111.0" data-end="114.0"> 
This phase can be both visual or </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="114.0" data-end="115.0"> 
in code.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="115.0" data-end="117.0"> 
And as you make your way around </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="117.0" data-end="118.0"> 
this lifecycle, you eventually </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="118.0" data-end="120.0"> 
end up with your app on the App </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="120.0" data-end="123.0"> 
Store followed with an analysis </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="123.0" data-end="125.0"> 
of how your app is doing on the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="126.0" data-end="127.0"> 
App Store.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="127.0" data-end="128.0"> 
Now more specifically, we're </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="128.0" data-end="130.0"> 
going to focus on a few key </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="130.0" data-end="131.0"> 
areas of this lifecycle.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="132.0" data-end="133.0"> 
We're going to talk about </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="133.0" data-end="136.0"> 
changes to provisioning, user </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="136.0" data-end="138.0"> 
management, delivering your app </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="139.0" data-end="142.0"> 
into our system, beta testing </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="142.0" data-end="145.0"> 
the builds, and analyzing your </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="145.0" data-end="146.0"> 
biggest business drivers.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="148.0" data-end="148.0"> 
Now looking at all these </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="148.0" data-end="150.0"> 
different areas, you can imagine </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="151.0" data-end="152.0"> 
how something like automation </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="153.0" data-end="154.0"> 
could bring all these together </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="154.0" data-end="155.0"> 
quite nicely.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="155.0" data-end="157.0"> 
And we tend to agree which is </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="157.0" data-end="159.0"> 
why we're very excited because </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="159.0" data-end="161.0"> 
this summer we'll be releasing </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="161.0" data-end="162.0"> 
an all-new product focused </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="162.0" data-end="165.0"> 
around automation and we call it </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="165.0" data-end="167.0"> 
the App Store Connect API.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="168.0" data-end="172.0"> 
</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="172.0" data-end="174.0"> 
Now the App Store Connect API is </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="174.0" data-end="177.0"> 
simply a RESTful interface into </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="177.0" data-end="179.0"> 
your app management experience.</span></span>

In designing the API, we've </span></span>

designed it around strict </span></span>

extensive documentation for this </span></span>

API.</span></span>

You might be looking for </span></span>

references around resources and </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="214.0" data-end="216.0">

for your use cases.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="222.0" data-end="224.0">

other scenarios, this </span></span>

We'll be launching the API this </span></span>

summer.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="232.0" data-end="233.0"> 
And we will be launching with </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="233.0" data-end="235.0"> 
support for the areas of the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="235.0" data-end="236.0"> 
lifecycle we highlighted </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="236.0" data-end="236.0"> 
earlier.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="237.0" data-end="239.0"> 
Now as we add more features and </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="239.0" data-end="241.0"> 
support for other areas, we will </span></span>

you.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="244.0" data-end="247.0"> 
So going back to our lifecycle, </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="248.0" data-end="249.0"> 
let's talk through some </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="249.0" data-end="251.0"> 
enhancements and some API </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="251.0" data-end="252.0"> 
integrations.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="252.0" data-end="254.0"> 
We'll begin by talking about </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="254.0" data-end="255.0"> 
provisioning.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="256.0" data-end="262.0"> 
Now today, many of you rely on </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="262.0" data-end="263.0"> 
Xcode to manage your </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="263.0" data-end="264.0"> 
provisioning automatically.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="265.0" data-end="266.0"> 
But for some of you who are </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="266.0" data-end="266.0"> 
looking for a little more </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="266.0" data-end="269.0"> 
control, today you sign into the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="269.0" data-end="271.0"> 
Apple Developer website to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="271.0" data-end="273.0"> 
generate the resources you need </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="273.0" data-end="274.0"> 
to sign your apps.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="275.0" data-end="278.0"> 
Well, with the API this summer, </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="278.0" data-end="279.0"> 
you'll be able to do a lot of </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="279.0" data-end="280.0"> 
these things directly.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="281.0" data-end="283.0"> 
The API will support generating </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="283.0" data-end="285.0"> 
provisioning profiles, creating </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="285.0" data-end="286.0"> 
and revoking signing </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="286.0" data-end="288.0"> 
certificates as well as managing </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="288.0" data-end="291.0"> 
your devices and your app bundle </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="291.0" data-end="291.0"> 
IDs.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="291.0" data-end="293.0"> 
This should make it a little bit </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="293.0" data-end="295.0"> 
easier for you to integrate your </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="295.0" data-end="297.0"> 
provisioning activities into </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="297.0" data-end="298.0"> 
your automation process.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="299.0" data-end="305.0"> 
</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="306.0" data-end="307.0"> 
So early on in the lifecycle </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="308.0" data-end="309.0"> 
while you're thinking about </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="309.0" data-end="310.0"> 
provisioning, you're probably </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="310.0" data-end="312.0"> 
also thinking about managing </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="312.0" data-end="313.0"> 
your users.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="313.0" data-end="316.0"> 
Now the API is going to support </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="317.0" data-end="319.0"> 
inviting new users to App Store </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="319.0" data-end="321.0"> 
Connect, modifying which apps </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="321.0" data-end="324.0"> 
your users can see, managing </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="324.0" data-end="326.0"> 
your user's roles as well as </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="326.0" data-end="328.0"> 
updating profile details.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="329.0" data-end="331.0"> 
Now we didn't want to stop at </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="331.0" data-end="332.0"> 
simplifying your management </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="332.0" data-end="334.0"> 
experience with just the API.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="335.0" data-end="336.0"> 
We also wanted to take a look at </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="336.0" data-end="338.0"> 
how we could simplify where you </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="338.0" data-end="340.0"> 
go to manage your users in the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="340.0" data-end="341.0"> 
first place.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="342.0" data-end="344.0"> 
Today, you go to both App Store </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="344.0" data-end="347.0"> 
Connect and the Apple Developer </span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="348.0" data-end="350.0"> 
But starting this summer, you'll </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="350.0" data-end="352.0"> 
be able to go to just one place.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="353.0" data-end="358.0"> 
</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="359.0" data-end="360.0"> 
And that's App Store Connect.</span></span>

Coming to App Store Connect, </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="363.0" data-end="364.0"> 
you'll be able to think about </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="364.0" data-end="365.0"> 
all of your users within the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="365.0" data-end="367.0"> 
context of just one set of </span></span>

roles.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="368.0" data-end="370.0"> 
And you can manage just one </span></span>

account for each of your Apple </span></span>

IDs.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="374.0" data-end="376.0"> 
Now we know that App Store </span></span>

systems.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="379.0" data-end="381.0"> 
So you might be wondering how is </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="381.0" data-end="383.0"> 
all this going to come together? </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="383.0" data-end="385.0"> 
Well, that's why we've built a </span></span>

way for you to see how your </span></span>

complete.</span></span>

Once we have this preview </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="393.0" data-end="395.0"> 
available, we'll let you know </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="395.0" data-end="397.0"> 
via Developer News and on the </span></span>

Of course, some of your users </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="413.0" data-end="414.0"> 
won't be changing at all.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="414.0" data-end="417.0"> 
Now if you click into a single </span></span>

one of these users, you'll be </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="419.0" data-end="421.0"> 
able to pull up a modal giving </span></span>

that user including what their </span></span>

forward.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="428.0" data-end="429.0"> 
We encourage you to come in to </span></span>

All right.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="455.0" data-end="457.0"> 
So while some of you were </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="457.0" data-end="459.0">

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="545.0" data-end="551.0"> 
Okay. So now that we have a few </span></span>

builds in the system, it's time </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="553.0" data-end="554.0"> 
to beta test them.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="555.0" data-end="556.0"> 
And, of course, beta testing </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="557.0" data-end="558.0"> 
means TestFlight.</span></span>

TestFlight.</span></span>

</p>

<p>

We've got a new feature to tell </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="580.0" data-end="582.0"> 
Today, all you need to invite </span></span>

someone to TestFlight is their </span></span>

e-mail address.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="585.0" data-end="587.0"> 
You simply enter their e-mail </span></span>

invitation.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="590.0" data-end="592.0"> 
Tapping on the invitation will </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="592.0" data-end="594.0"> 
launch TestFlight where they can </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="594.0" data-end="595.0"> 
install your beta app.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="595.0" data-end="598.0"> 
It's pretty awesome, but if </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="598.0" data-end="598.0"> 
you're dealing with a lot of </span></span>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="601.0" data-end="602.0"> 
And if you're working with </span></span>

testers who don't have an e-mail </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="606.0" data-end="606.0"> 
to invite them.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="607.0" data-end="609.0"> 
We think we can do even better, </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="609.0" data-end="612.0"> 
and we call it TestFlight public </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="612.0" data-end="612.0"> 
link.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="613.0" data-end="615.0"> 
</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="615.0" data-end="616.0"> 
This is really exciting.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="617.0" data-end="620.0"> 
Public link is a unique URL that </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="620.0" data-end="622.0"> 
represents an open invitation to </span></span>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="624.0" data-end="625.0"> 
You can share it anywhere you'd </span></span>

like.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="627.0" data-end="629.0"> 
And it can be used by anyone to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="629.0" data-end="632.0"> 
become a new tester.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="633.0" data-end="635.0"> 
So public links can be shared </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="635.0" data-end="636.0"> 
anywhere that a regular link can </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="636.0" data-end="637.0"> 
be shared.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="637.0" data-end="639.0"> 
This means you can send a public </span></span>

link directly to someone, or you </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="641.0" data-end="642.0">

link.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="650.0" data-end="651.0"> 
This would launch TestFlight </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="651.0" data-end="652.0"> 
where they can install your beta </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="652.0" data-end="654.0"> 
app and instantly become one of </span></span>

your testers.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="655.0" data-end="656.0"> 
It's really easy.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="656.0" data-end="658.0"> 
You don't have to collect any </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="658.0" data-end="658.0"> 
information.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="659.0" data-end="660.0"> 
You simply make the link </span></span>

available and testers can join.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="664.0" data-end="666.0"> 
So let me show how we can create </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="666.0" data-end="667.0"> 
a public link.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="667.0" data-end="670.0"> 
In TestFlight, groups allow you </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="670.0" data-end="672.0"> 
to organize your testers and </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="672.0" data-end="674.0"> 
decide which builds each group </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="674.0" data-end="676.0"> 
of testers should have access </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="676.0" data-end="676.0"> 
to.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="677.0" data-end="678.0"> 
We'll need to create a group </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="678.0" data-end="679.0"> 
before we can generate a public </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="679.0" data-end="680.0"> 
link.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="680.0" data-end="682.0"> 
And we can do that by clicking </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="682.0" data-end="684.0"> 
new group in the left nav and </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="684.0" data-end="688.0"> 
then giving the group a name.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="688.0" data-end="690.0"> 
Now before we create a public </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="690.0" data-end="692.0"> 
link and start bringing testers </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="692.0" data-end="693.0"> 
in, we want to make sure there </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="693.0" data-end="695.0"> 
is a build that they can test.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="695.0" data-end="698.0"> 
So first we'll add a build to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="698.0" data-end="698.0"> 
this group.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="699.0" data-end="701.0"> 
We do that by going to the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="701.0" data-end="703.0"> 
builds tab and clicking the plus </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="703.0" data-end="705.0"> 
button next to build.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="706.0" data-end="707.0"> 
This will show all the builds </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="707.0" data-end="708.0"> 
we've uploaded.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="708.0" data-end="710.0"> 
And we can choose one that we </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="710.0" data-end="711.0"> 
want to distribute.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="711.0" data-end="715.0"> 
Now that this group has a build, </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="715.0" data-end="717.0"> 
we can create a public link for </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="717.0" data-end="717.0"> 
this group.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="718.0" data-end="720.0"> 
We'll go back to the testers tab </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="721.0" data-end="724.0"> 
and click enable public link.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="725.0" data-end="727.0"> 
This generates a unique URL that </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="727.0" data-end="729.0"> 
we can share anywhere to reach </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="729.0" data-end="730.0"> 
new testers.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="733.0" data-end="734.0"> 
And testers who join through </span></span>

that link are automatically </span></span>

added to the group.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="737.0" data-end="739.0"> 
So when you're ready to deliver </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="739.0" data-end="740.0"> 
a new build, you simply add the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="740.0" data-end="741.0"> 
build to the group.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="742.0" data-end="744.0"> 
You can see how this is a much </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="744.0" data-end="746.0"> 
faster way to bring in up to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="746.0" data-end="747.0">

<p>

each public link.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="761.0" data-end="762.0"> 
This would put a cap on the </span></span>

number of testers who could join </span></span>

Cool. So it's actually quite a </span></span>

bit of you.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1250.0" data-end="1251.0"> 
So that's awesome.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1252.0" data-end="1253.0"> 
And that's exactly why we've </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1253.0" data-end="1255.0"> 
introduce the ability to select </span></span>

which development team you'd </span></span>

Connect.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1259.0" data-end="1261.0"> 
So we'll tap the little account </span></span>

button.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1262.0" data-end="1263.0"> 
That brings up settings.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1264.0" data-end="1265.0"> 
And you'll see the account cell.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1266.0" data-end="1268.0"> 
We'll tap into that, select the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1268.0" data-end="1269.0"> 
team that we'd like to see </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1269.0" data-end="1272.0"> 
within App Store Connect, and </span></span>

dismiss this.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1273.0" data-end="1275.0"> 
Now we see exactly the apps that </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1275.0" data-end="1276.0"> 
we're interested in right now.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1278.0" data-end="1280.0"> 
Let's go ahead and take a look </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1280.0" data-end="1281.0"> 
at one of the apps within our </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1281.0" data-end="1283.0"> 
apps list, Mountain Climber.</span></span>

When we tap into Mountain </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1285.0" data-end="1286.0"> 
Climber, you'll see four </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1286.0" data-end="1287.0"> 
sections.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1288.0" data-end="1289.0"> 
The first section that you see </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1289.0" data-end="1290.0"> 
is the iOS app section.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1291.0" data-end="1292.0"> 
And here you'll see your iOS </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1292.0" data-end="1293.0"> 
versions.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1293.0" data-end="1295.0"> 
If your app has a tvOS app </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1295.0" data-end="1298.0"> 
version, you'll see the tvOS app </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1298.0" data-end="1300.0"> 
section and, obviously, the tvOS </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1300.0" data-end="1301.0"> 
app versions underneath.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1302.0" data-end="1304.0"> 
Now we also have App Store </span></span>

information.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1305.0" data-end="1306.0"> 
And remember that I noted that </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1306.0" data-end="1308.0"> 
you can see your apps trends </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1308.0" data-end="1309.0"> 
data individually.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1309.0" data-end="1311.0"> 
Well, all you have to do is tap </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1311.0" data-end="1312.0"> 
into that cell and you'll be </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1312.0" data-end="1313.0"> 
taken there.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1314.0" data-end="1316.0"> 
Now, finally we have </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1316.0" data-end="1317.0"> 
notifications.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1317.0" data-end="1319.0"> 
And we're going to do something </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1319.0" data-end="1320.0"> 
a bit unorthodox here.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1320.0" data-end="1321.0"> 
We're actually going to start </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1321.0" data-end="1322.0"> 
from all the way at the bottom </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1323.0" data-end="1324.0"> 
with notifications.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1326.0" data-end="1326.0"> 
There are two types of </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1326.0" data-end="1328.0"> 
notifications that you can </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1328.0" data-end="1330.0"> 
receive within the App Store </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1330.0" data-end="1330.0"> 
Connect app.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1331.0" data-end="1333.0"> 
The first one is for app status </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1333.0" data-end="1333.0"> 
changes.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1333.0" data-end="1335.0"> 
And this is something like when </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1335.0" data-end="1337.0"> 
your app is in review and then </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1337.0" data-end="1339.0"> 
goes to pending developer </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1339.0" data-end="1340.0"> 
release when it's approved.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1341.0" data-end="1343.0"> 
The next one that you can take </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1343.0" data-end="1346.0"> 
is for reviews with a certain </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1346.0" data-end="1347.0"> 
star rating.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1348.0" data-end="1349.0"> 
And so we're going to go ahead </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1349.0" data-end="1351.0"> 
and select the five-star review </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1351.0" data-end="1353.0"> 
because we want to thank users </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1353.0" data-end="1355.0"> 
that are enjoying our app as </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1355.0" data-end="1357.0"> 
well as the one-star review </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1357.0" data-end="1358.0"> 
because we want to engage users </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1358.0" data-end="1360.0"> 
that, for whatever reason, are </span></span>

not having the best of </span></span>

experiences.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1363.0" data-end="1364.0"> 
Now that we've selected our </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1364.0" data-end="1365.0"> 
notifications, we're going to go </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1365.0" data-end="1366.0"> 
back to the app view.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1367.0" data-end="1369.0"> 
The reason why we started with </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1369.0" data-end="1371.0"> 
notifications is because one of </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1371.0" data-end="1373.0"> 
the key tenets of the App Store </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1373.0" data-end="1375.0"> 
Connect experience on iOS is </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1375.0" data-end="1376.0"> 
giving you the ability to take a </span></span>

quick action around your apps </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1379.0" data-end="1380.0"> 
and letting you know when you </span></span>

can do so.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1382.0" data-end="1383.0"> 
So we know that you've taken -- </span></span>

you've spent countless hours </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1386.0" data-end="1386.0"> 
working on your apps.</span></span>

You've distributed them to beta </span></span>

testers via TestFlight.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1391.0" data-end="1392.0"> 
You've taken those testers </span></span>

feedback, iterated upon that </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1394.0" data-end="1396.0"> 
with your apps, and finally you </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1396.0" data-end="1397.0"> 
have a build that's ready for </span></span>

release to the world.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1399.0" data-end="1400.0"> 
Now one of the last things you </span></span>

have to do before releasing your </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1403.0" data-end="1405.0"> 
submitting your build to app </span></span>

One of the notifications that we </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1413.0" data-end="1414.0"> 
This means that when your app is </span></span>

approved by app review, you'll </span></span>

you are.</span></span>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1429.0" data-end="1431.0">

two buttons.</span></span>

this big red button.</span></span>

now we see release this version </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1444.0" data-end="1445.0"> 
and that's exactly what we want </span></span>

to do.</span></span>

We'll tap there.</span></span>

We'll get a confirmation dialog </span></span>

and we'll hit release.</span></span>

Now we sent that build off to </span></span>

this is one of them.</span></span>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1458.0" data-end="1460.0"> 
Right. Sometimes your app may be </span></span>

rejected by app review.</span></span>

And, obviously, that's something </span></span>

that no one wants to see.</span></span>

Later in our session, my </span></span>

But what should we do now? </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1473.0" data-end="1474.0"> 
We need to make sure that we can </span></span>

We've also optimized App Store </span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1574.0" data-end="1575.0"> 
So let's take a quick look.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1576.0" data-end="1578.0"> 
As I mentioned earlier, you can </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1578.0" data-end="1579.0"> 
view a certain apps sales and </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1579.0" data-end="1580.0">

Forest Explorer.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1584.0" data-end="1585.0"> 
You can see units.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1585.0" data-end="1586.0"> 
And we'll scroll down to updates </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1587.0" data-end="1589.0"> 
and also drill down into the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1589.0" data-end="1590.0"> 
territories view.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1591.0" data-end="1593.0"> 
Now I'm sure you want to try </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1593.0" data-end="1594.0"> 
this out on your own.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1594.0" data-end="1596.0"> 
And our app is actually </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1596.0" data-end="1596.0"> 
available now.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1596.0" data-end="1597.0"> 
So if you haven't downloaded it </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1598.0" data-end="1599.0"> 
already, please go ahead and do </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1599.0" data-end="1600.0"> 
so.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1600.0" data-end="1601.0"> 
We've worked hard to bring an </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1601.0" data-end="1603.0"> 
experience -- an improved mobile </span></span>

And we hope you'll enjoy using </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1606.0" data-end="1607.0"> 
it as much as we enjoyed </span></span>

creating it.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1608.0" data-end="1610.0"> 
And with that, now back to </span></span>

 Thanks, Alex.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1618.0" data-end="1620.0"> 
So that's a beautiful new app </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1620.0" data-end="1622.0"> 
that'll give you even more power </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1622.0" data-end="1624.0"> 
to manage your apps on the go.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1626.0" data-end="1628.0"> 
So next we'd like to talk about </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1628.0" data-end="1630.0"> 
a guideline change we made just </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1630.0" data-end="1633.0"> 
this week that will let those of </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1633.0" data-end="1635.0"> 
you with paid apps offer </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1635.0" data-end="1638.0"> 
time-based free trials for your </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1638.0" data-end="1638.0"> 
customers.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1639.0" data-end="1643.0"> 
Now those of you who are using </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1643.0" data-end="1644.0"> 
subscriptions today know that </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1644.0" data-end="1647.0"> 
free trials are a great way to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1647.0" data-end="1648.0"> 
attract new customers to your </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1648.0" data-end="1649.0"> 
services.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1649.0" data-end="1650.0"> 
But we also know that </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1650.0" data-end="1653.0"> 
subscriptions aren't the model </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1653.0" data-end="1655.0"> 
that works for every app which </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1655.0" data-end="1657.0"> 
is why we're happy to now have a </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1657.0" data-end="1658.0"> 
path for paid apps.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1659.0" data-end="1661.0"> 
So we're going to take a look at </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1661.0" data-end="1662.0"> 
what this setup looks like.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1663.0" data-end="1665.0"> 
So let's say we start with a </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1665.0" data-end="1666.0"> 
paid app.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1667.0" data-end="1668.0"> 
The first thing you would do is </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1668.0" data-end="1671.0"> 
turn your paid app into a free </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1671.0" data-end="1671.0"> 
app.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1672.0" data-end="1675.0"> 
Now on top of this free app, </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1675.0" data-end="1676.0"> 
you're going to add two </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1676.0" data-end="1678.0"> 
non-consumable in-app purchases.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1679.0" data-end="1682.0"> 
The first is a free tier 0 </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1682.0" data-end="1684.0"> 
priced non-consumable.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1684.0" data-end="1685.0"> 
And you'll present this to your </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1685.0" data-end="1687.0"> 
customers when they launch the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1687.0" data-end="1690.0"> 
app so that they can opt-in to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1690.0" data-end="1690.0"> 
the free trial.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1691.0" data-end="1695.0"> 
Now the second non-consumable is </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1695.0" data-end="1696.0"> 
the in-app purchase that you use </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1696.0" data-end="1698.0"> 
to unlock your app functionality </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1698.0" data-end="1700.0"> 
for that customer for good.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1701.0" data-end="1703.0"> 
You can present this at any </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1703.0" data-end="1704.0"> 
point; in the beginning when </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1704.0" data-end="1706.0"> 
they launch the app or when </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1706.0" data-end="1707.0"> 
their free trial is complete.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1708.0" data-end="1712.0"> 
Now in order to use this setup, </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1712.0" data-end="1714.0"> 
there are a few guidelines to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1714.0" data-end="1715.0"> 
look out for and to follow.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1716.0" data-end="1720.0"> 
First, make sure you name your </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1720.0" data-end="1723.0"> 
trial in-app purchase with this </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1723.0" data-end="1724.0"> 
naming convention.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1724.0" data-end="1727.0"> 
And next, you'll want to make </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1727.0" data-end="1728.0"> 
sure that it's very clear to the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1728.0" data-end="1729.0"> 
customer exactly what they are </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1729.0" data-end="1730.0"> 
signing up for.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1731.0" data-end="1733.0"> 
So please make sure that they </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1733.0" data-end="1734.0"> 
know how long the free trial is </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1734.0" data-end="1736.0"> 
going to last, how much it'll </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1736.0" data-end="1738.0"> 
cost to unlock the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1738.0" data-end="1740.0"> 
functionality, and what kind of </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1740.0" data-end="1742.0"> 
features and content won't be </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1742.0" data-end="1744.0"> 
available anymore after the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1744.0" data-end="1746.0"> 
trial if they decide not to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1746.0" data-end="1746.0"> 
continue.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1750.0" data-end="1750.0"> 
All right.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1750.0" data-end="1752.0"> 
So we talked about a number of </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1752.0" data-end="1753.0"> 
new features today.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1753.0" data-end="1754.0"> 
So let's take a second to recap </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1754.0" data-end="1755.0"> 
them.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1756.0" data-end="1757.0"> 
First, we're launching an </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1757.0" data-end="1759.0"> 
all-new App Store Connect API </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1759.0" data-end="1760.0"> 
this summer.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1761.0" data-end="1764.0"> 
We're unifying where you go to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1764.0" data-end="1765.0"> 
manage your users.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1765.0" data-end="1770.0"> 
We've extended app Transporter </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1770.0" data-end="1772.0"> 
to support Linux.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1773.0" data-end="1775.0"> 
We're launching TestFlight </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1775.0" data-end="1777.0"> 
public links, which will make it </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1777.0" data-end="1779.0"> 
a lot easier for you to invite </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1779.0" data-end="1780.0"> 
large numbers of testers.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1781.0" data-end="1783.0"> 
We've launched a brand-new sales </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1783.0" data-end="1786.0"> 
and trends overview page, a new </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1786.0" data-end="1788.0"> 
App Store Connect for iOS page, </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1789.0" data-end="1790.0"> 
and a path for you to offer </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1790.0" data-end="1793.0"> 
trials to customers on your paid </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1793.0" data-end="1794.0"> 
apps.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1794.0" data-end="1796.0"> 
Now these are features that will </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1796.0" data-end="1798.0"> 
be launching between now and the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1798.0" data-end="1799.0"> 
end of the summer.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1799.0" data-end="1801.0"> 
But we also have two significant </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1801.0" data-end="1803.0"> 
features we launched over the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1803.0" data-end="1804.0"> 
past year that we'd like to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1804.0" data-end="1805.0"> 
highlight.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1806.0" data-end="1808.0"> 
And these are intro pricing and </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1808.0" data-end="1809.0"> 
pre-orders.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1809.0" data-end="1813.0"> 
So introductory pricing, for </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1813.0" data-end="1814.0"> 
those of you who use </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1814.0" data-end="1817.0"> 
subscriptions, is a great way to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1817.0" data-end="1818.0"> 
incentivize new customers to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1818.0" data-end="1820.0"> 
sign up for your subscriptions.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1820.0" data-end="1823.0"> 
Now you do this by offering your </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1823.0" data-end="1825.0"> 
customers a discounted </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1825.0" data-end="1827.0"> 
introductory price at the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1827.0" data-end="1829.0"> 
beginning of your subscription.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1829.0" data-end="1831.0"> 
There are three different </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1831.0" data-end="1832.0"> 
pricing models we offer for </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1832.0" data-end="1832.0"> 
this.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1833.0" data-end="1835.0"> 
First, we have free trials.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1836.0" data-end="1838.0"> 
Now with free trials, your </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1838.0" data-end="1840.0"> 
customers sign up for free.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1841.0" data-end="1843.0"> 
They use your services for the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1843.0" data-end="1844.0"> 
introductory period.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1844.0" data-end="1845.0"> 
And at the end of the period, </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1846.0" data-end="1847.0"> 
they move on to your regular </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1847.0" data-end="1848.0"> 
subscription price.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1849.0" data-end="1851.0"> 
Next, we have a model that we </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1851.0" data-end="1852.0"> 
call pay upfront.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1853.0" data-end="1854.0"> 
With this model, your customers </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1854.0" data-end="1856.0"> 
sign up and they pay one time at </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1856.0" data-end="1857.0"> 
the beginning of your </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1857.0" data-end="1858.0"> 
introductory period.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1858.0" data-end="1859.0"> 
And, again, at the end of the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1859.0" data-end="1861.0"> 
period, the regular subscription </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1861.0" data-end="1863.0"> 
price kicks in.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1864.0" data-end="1866.0"> 
And finally, we have pay as you </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1866.0" data-end="1867.0"> 
go.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1867.0" data-end="1869.0"> 
With pay as you go, your </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1869.0" data-end="1871.0"> 
customers pay a recurring </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1871.0" data-end="1873.0"> 
discounted price during the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1873.0" data-end="1874.0"> 
introductory period.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1875.0" data-end="1877.0"> 
Now once the entire period has </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1877.0" data-end="1879.0"> 
been completed then they move on </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1879.0" data-end="1880.0"> 
to the regular subscription </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1880.0" data-end="1881.0"> 
price.</span></span>
