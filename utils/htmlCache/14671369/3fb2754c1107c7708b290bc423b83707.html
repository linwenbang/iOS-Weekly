							<h1>Automating App Store Connect</h1>
							<p>The new App Store Connect API provides a familiar and highly readable REST API designed to facilitate the automation of many tasks you would typically perform through the Apple Developer website and the App Store Connect browser interfaces. Learn how this API allows you to manage your apps and testers for TestFlight, create code signing resources, download reports, and even manage your organization. See how this API leverages JWT authentication and a JSON payload for all transactions to make this new service easy to integrate with your existing automated workflows.</p>

I'm Geoff Coffey.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="36.0" data-end="38.0"> 
I'm an engineer on App Store </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="38.0" data-end="39.0"> 
Connect and I'm here to talk to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="39.0" data-end="41.0"> 
about automating App Store </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="41.0" data-end="41.0"> 
Connect.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="42.0" data-end="43.0"> 
And I got to be honest with you, </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="43.0" data-end="44.0"> 
I'm really excited about what </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="44.0" data-end="45.0"> 
we're going to talk about today.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="47.0" data-end="48.0"> 
So let's start by talking about </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="48.0" data-end="49.0"> 
where we are with automation in </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="49.0" data-end="51.0"> 
App Store Connect today.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="51.0" data-end="52.0"> 
As I'm sure you all know, you </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="52.0" data-end="54.0"> 
can use Xcode to upload your </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="54.0" data-end="56.0"> 
builds to App Store Connect and </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="56.0" data-end="58.0"> 
to download your crash reports </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="58.0" data-end="60.0"> 
and we have the Transporter tool </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="60.0" data-end="61.0"> 
that lets you automate uploading </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="61.0" data-end="64.0"> 
the metadata.xml and also </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="64.0" data-end="65.0"> 
automate your build uploads.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="65.0" data-end="67.0"> 
And then we have Reporter, the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="67.0" data-end="68.0"> 
command line tool for </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="68.0" data-end="69.0"> 
downloading your sales and </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="69.0" data-end="70.0"> 
financial reports.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="71.0" data-end="72.0"> 
And these tools are great.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="72.0" data-end="74.0"> 
A lot of you use them but we've </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="74.0" data-end="75.0"> 
heard from you that you want </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="75.0" data-end="76.0"> 
even more.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="76.0" data-end="78.0"> 
You want access to more areas in </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="78.0" data-end="80.0"> 
App Store Connect and you want </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="80.0" data-end="81.0"> 
to integrate with more diverse </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="81.0" data-end="82.0"> 
workflows.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="82.0" data-end="83.0"> 
And so we're really happy to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="83.0" data-end="85.0"> 
introduce the new App Store </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="85.0" data-end="85.0"> 
Connect API.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="86.0" data-end="93.0"> 
</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="94.0" data-end="94.0"> 
We're excited too.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="95.0" data-end="97.0"> 
So this is a standards-based </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="97.0" data-end="99.0"> 
REST API for App Store Connect.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="100.0" data-end="101.0"> 
And if you ask me, that's the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="101.0" data-end="103.0"> 
best part about it, it's a stock </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="103.0" data-end="105.0"> 
standard REST API with JSON </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="105.0" data-end="106.0"> 
responses, so it's going to feel </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="106.0" data-end="108.0"> 
familiar to a lot of you right </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="108.0" data-end="108.0"> 
out of the box.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="109.0" data-end="110.0"> 
That also means you can use this </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="110.0" data-end="112.0"> 
API from any platform, almost </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="112.0" data-end="114.0"> 
any programming language, and </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="114.0" data-end="115.0"> 
using the tools that you're </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="115.0" data-end="117.0"> 
probably already using today.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="117.0" data-end="119.0"> 
And of course, the API needs to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="119.0" data-end="120.0"> 
be secure.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="120.0" data-end="122.0"> 
So we use industry-standard JSON </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="122.0" data-end="124.0"> 
web tokens for authentication.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="124.0" data-end="126.0"> 
And that just means you don't </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="126.0" data-end="127.0"> 
have to pass usernames and </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="127.0" data-end="129.0"> 
passwords around, and you don't </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="129.0" data-end="130.0"> 
have to have your code tied to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="130.0" data-end="132.0"> 
any specific person on your team </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="132.0" data-end="134.0"> 
but you still maintain control </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="134.0" data-end="135.0"> 
of who can access your data and </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="135.0" data-end="136.0"> 
what they can do.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="137.0" data-end="139.0"> 
From an ease-of-use standpoint, </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="139.0" data-end="141.0"> 
we focus really closely on </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="141.0" data-end="142.0"> 
consistency with this API.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="143.0" data-end="145.0"> 
We have a single unified REST </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="145.0" data-end="147.0"> 
resource model, which just means </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="147.0" data-end="148.0"> 
that you can take what you learn </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="148.0" data-end="149.0"> 
in any one part of the API and </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="150.0" data-end="151.0"> 
apply it to every other part.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="152.0" data-end="153.0"> 
And we've also built </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="192.0" data-end="194.0"> 
Now we started with a focus on </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="194.0" data-end="195.0"> 
the areas of App Store Connect </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="196.0" data-end="198.0">

again and in particular we're </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="201.0" data-end="203.0"> 
starting with these four areas </span></span>

you see here.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="204.0" data-end="205.0"> 
So let's look at what all is </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="205.0" data-end="206.0"> 
included.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="206.0" data-end="208.0"> 
First, we have comprehensive </span></span>

we just announced a new public </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="220.0" data-end="222.0"> 
And this works hand-in-hand with </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="222.0" data-end="222.0"> 
the API.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="222.0" data-end="224.0"> 
You can use the API to manage </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="224.0" data-end="226.0"> 
your public links and you can </span></span>

whatever way works best for you.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="231.0" data-end="234.0"> 
On the Users and Roles side, you </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="234.0" data-end="235.0"> 
can add and remove users and </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="235.0" data-end="236.0"> 
keep the permissions on your </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="240.0" data-end="241.0"> 
And as we announced yesterday, </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="241.0" data-end="242.0"> 
this includes your complete </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="242.0" data-end="244.0">

Connect.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="246.0" data-end="248.0"> 
So you have one set of users and </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="248.0" data-end="249.0"> 
one set of roles.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="250.0" data-end="255.0"> 
</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="256.0" data-end="257.0"> 
We have provisioning APIs that </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="257.0" data-end="259.0"> 
let you add development devices </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="259.0" data-end="260.0">

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="260.0" data-end="262.0"> 
manage your certificates and </span></span>

reports APIs that let you </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="268.0" data-end="269.0"> 
And if you use the Reporter tool </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="269.0" data-end="270.0"> 
today, this will feel really </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="270.0" data-end="271.0"> 
familiar to you because the </span></span>

parameters you send to Reporter </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="273.0" data-end="274.0"> 
are very similar to the ones you </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="274.0" data-end="275.0"> 
send to the API.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="275.0" data-end="276.0"> 
So it's really easy to make the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="276.0" data-end="277.0"> 
switch.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="278.0" data-end="279.0"> 
And I said there were four </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="279.0" data-end="281.0"> 
things and this last part isn't </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="281.0" data-end="282.0"> 
really part of the API itself </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="282.0" data-end="283.0"> 
but I wanted to bring it up </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="283.0" data-end="284.0"> 
because it's an important part </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="284.0" data-end="286.0"> 
of our automation story.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="286.0" data-end="287.0"> 
We've made a couple of important </span></span>

changes the Transporter to help </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="289.0" data-end="290.0"> 
smooth all of this out for you.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="290.0" data-end="292.0"> 
First of all, Transporter will </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="292.0" data-end="293.0"> 
officially be supported on </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="293.0" data-end="293.0"> 
Linux.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="294.0" data-end="296.0"> 
And also, you can take the API </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="296.0" data-end="298.0"> 
tokens that you use for the new </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="298.0" data-end="299.0"> 
API and send those through to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="299.0" data-end="300.0"> 
Transporter and it can use those </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="300.0" data-end="300.0"> 
for authentication as well.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="301.0" data-end="304.0"> 
It just makes the process easier </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="304.0" data-end="304.0"> 
to manage for you.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="305.0" data-end="308.0"> 
Okay, we have a whole bunch to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="308.0" data-end="308.0"> 
get through.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="308.0" data-end="309.0"> 
We're going to go kind of fast </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="309.0" data-end="309.0"> 
today.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="310.0" data-end="311.0"> 
I apologize for that but we have </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="311.0" data-end="311.0"> 
a lot to cover.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="312.0" data-end="312.0"> 
We're going to talk about </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="312.0" data-end="314.0"> 
getting data and changing data </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="314.0" data-end="314.0"> 
with the API.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="315.0" data-end="316.0"> 
We'll talk about relationships </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="316.0" data-end="317.0"> 
which is how the different parts </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="317.0" data-end="319.0"> 
of the API fit together and how </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="319.0" data-end="320.0"> 
you work with those.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="320.0" data-end="321.0"> 
We'll talk about how to handle </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="321.0" data-end="323.0"> 
errors, how to get access to the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="323.0" data-end="324.0"> 
API and authenticate your </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="324.0" data-end="326.0"> 
request, then we'll wrap up with </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="326.0" data-end="327.0"> 
some best practices.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="328.0" data-end="329.0"> 
So, you ready to get started? </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="330.0" data-end="333.0"> 
</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="334.0" data-end="335.0"> 
So like I said, we're going to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="335.0" data-end="336.0"> 
start with getting data and that </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="336.0" data-end="337.0"> 
means we start right here, </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="338.0" data-end="340.0"> 
api.appstoreconnect.apple.com.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="341.0" data-end="342.0"> 
This is the home base of the API </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="343.0" data-end="344.0"> 
and from here we want to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="344.0" data-end="345.0"> 
construct a URL.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="346.0" data-end="348.0"> 
First we will add a version.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="348.0" data-end="350.0"> 
Now all API endpoints have a </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="350.0" data-end="351.0"> 
version and right now that's </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="351.0" data-end="351.0"> 
always v1.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="351.0" data-end="354.0"> 
But inevitably as App Store </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="354.0" data-end="355.0"> 
Connect grows and changes over </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="355.0" data-end="357.0"> 
time, we'll have to make changes </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="357.0" data-end="359.0"> 
to the API that might cause your </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="359.0" data-end="360.0"> 
code to stop working.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="360.0" data-end="361.0"> 
So when that ever happens, we'll </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="361.0" data-end="363.0"> 
change this version number and </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="363.0" data-end="364.0"> 
the old version will keep </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="364.0" data-end="366.0"> 
working for a period of time so </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="366.0" data-end="367.0"> 
you have time to adjust to our </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="367.0" data-end="367.0"> 
changes.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="368.0" data-end="370.0"> 
Now after the version, we have </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="370.0" data-end="371.0"> 
to add something called the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="371.0" data-end="372.0"> 
resource type name.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="373.0" data-end="374.0"> 
This is a really important </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="374.0" data-end="375.0"> 
concept in the API.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="375.0" data-end="377.0"> 
The resource is like the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="377.0" data-end="379.0"> 
fundamental unit of the API.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="379.0" data-end="380.0"> 
Conceptually, you can almost </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="380.0" data-end="382.0"> 
think of the API as a big </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="382.0" data-end="384.0"> 
collection of resources that you </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="384.0" data-end="384.0"> 
operate on.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="385.0" data-end="386.0"> 
We have a whole bunch of </span></span>

resources in the API.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="388.0" data-end="389.0"> 
Most of them map to things </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="389.0" data-end="390.0"> 
you're familiar with in App </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="390.0" data-end="391.0">

their first name, last name, and </span></span>

The values of these attributes </span></span>

are usually simple types like </span></span>

can also be complex types </span></span>

sometimes, like arrays and </span></span>

objects.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="468.0" data-end="469.0"> 
After the attributes, we have </span></span>

relationships.</span></span>

We're going to skip those for </span></span>

now.</span></span>

later.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="473.0" data-end="474.0"> 
And then we have links and in </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="474.0" data-end="475.0"> 
particular what we call the </span></span>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="478.0" data-end="480.0"> 
Now this is a URL that uniquely </span></span>

identifies this particular </span></span>

link.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="489.0" data-end="490.0"> 
It always looks like this: </span></span>

api.appstoreconnect.apple.com </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="493.0" data-end="495.0"> 
and then the version, v1, and </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="495.0" data-end="497.0"> 
then the resource type, users, </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="497.0" data-end="499.0"> 
and then the identifier of that </span></span>

resource.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="500.0" data-end="502.0"> 
And you can go get it and you </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="502.0" data-end="503.0"> 
get back data that looks almost </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="503.0" data-end="504.0"> 
exactly like what we just saw.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="505.0" data-end="506.0"> 
The only difference here is </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="506.0" data-end="507.0"> 
we're seeing just this one user </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="507.0" data-end="509.0"> 
now instead of all the users on </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="509.0" data-end="510.0"> 
your team.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="510.0" data-end="514.0"> 
So that's two ways to get data.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="514.0" data-end="516.0"> 
You get a list of resources or </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="516.0" data-end="517.0"> 
an individual resource, but of </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="517.0" data-end="518.0"> 
course you're going to want to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="518.0" data-end="520.0"> 
change data as well.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="520.0" data-end="522.0"> 
And to do that, we lean on </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="522.0" data-end="524.0"> 
common REST conventions, so this </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="524.0" data-end="525.0"> 
will also feel familiar to a lot </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="525.0" data-end="526.0"> 
of you.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="526.0" data-end="527.0"> 
You've already seen how to get </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="527.0" data-end="528.0"> 
resources.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="529.0" data-end="530.0"> 
To create a new resource, you'll </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="530.0" data-end="532.0"> 
use the http POST method.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="533.0" data-end="534.0"> 
To change a resource, you'll use </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="534.0" data-end="537.0"> 
PATCH, and to delete a resource, </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="537.0" data-end="538.0"> 
you'll use the DELETE method.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="539.0" data-end="540.0"> 
So let's try this.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="540.0" data-end="541.0"> 
Let's say we want to add a new </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="541.0" data-end="543.0"> 
user to your team.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="543.0" data-end="544.0"> 
Now a quick aside.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="544.0" data-end="546.0"> 
We can't add the user directly.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="546.0" data-end="548.0"> 
Just like in App Store Connect </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="548.0" data-end="549.0"> 
itself, you have to invite the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="549.0" data-end="551.0"> 
user to your team and then they </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="551.0" data-end="552.0"> 
can accept that invitation.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="553.0" data-end="555.0"> 
So we're going to create a user </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="555.0" data-end="557.0"> 
invitation resource.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="557.0" data-end="558.0"> 
It looks like this.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="558.0" data-end="560.0"> 
We do a POST because we're </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="560.0" data-end="560.0"> 
creating.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="561.0" data-end="562.0"> 
And the URL is the user </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="562.0" data-end="564.0"> 
Invitations resource URL.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="564.0" data-end="566.0"> 
And then we have to send in the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="566.0" data-end="567.0"> 
data for this user.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="568.0" data-end="569.0"> 
Now this data looks a lot like </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="569.0" data-end="571.0"> 
what you've seen when we fetched </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="571.0" data-end="572.0"> 
users before.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="572.0" data-end="573.0"> 
But there's one important </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="573.0" data-end="574.0"> 
difference I want to point out.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="575.0" data-end="577.0"> 
We have a type user Invitations </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="578.0" data-end="578.0"> 
but we don't have an ID.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="579.0" data-end="581.0"> 
Now Apple will assign an ID to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="581.0" data-end="582.0"> 
every resource you create for </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="582.0" data-end="583.0"> 
you.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="583.0" data-end="584.0"> 
So you don't include that in the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="584.0" data-end="585.0"> 
POST.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="585.0" data-end="587.0"> 
We've also left off links </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="587.0" data-end="588.0"> 
because they're not required for </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="588.0" data-end="588.0"> 
creation.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="588.0" data-end="590.0"> 
And we've left off relationships </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="590.0" data-end="591.0"> 
because they're not relevant in </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="591.0" data-end="592.0"> 
this particular case.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="593.0" data-end="594.0"> 
If we run this request, we get a </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="594.0" data-end="595.0"> 
response.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="596.0" data-end="598.0"> 
In particular, this is a 201 </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="600.0" data-end="601.0"> 
That's just standard REST </span></span>

resource was successfully </span></span>

created.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="605.0" data-end="606.0"> 
And we also include the full </span></span>

resource information in the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="608.0" data-end="610.0"> 
response data and this is </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="610.0" data-end="611.0"> 
important for two reasons.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="611.0" data-end="613.0"> 
First, it gives you the ID and </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="614.0" data-end="615.0"> 
the resource self link of the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="615.0" data-end="617.0"> 
resource that was created, which </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="617.0" data-end="618.0"> 
is stuff you're probably going </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="618.0" data-end="619.0"> 
to need later so you can come </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="619.0" data-end="621.0"> 
back and operate on this </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="621.0" data-end="621.0"> 
resource.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="622.0" data-end="623.0"> 
And also if you look at the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="623.0" data-end="625.0"> 
attributes, you may see </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="625.0" data-end="627.0"> 
attributes in this response that </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="627.0" data-end="628.0"> 
you didn't include in the POST.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="629.0" data-end="630.0"> 
For example with user </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="630.0" data-end="632.0"> 
invitations, Apple will assign </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="632.0" data-end="634.0"> 
an expiration Date to every user </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="634.0" data-end="635.0"> 
invitation you create.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="635.0" data-end="637.0"> 
Now you don't set that, so you </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="637.0" data-end="638.0"> 
don't include it in the POST.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="638.0" data-end="639.0"> 
And that's why this response </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="639.0" data-end="641.0"> 
data is really important to you.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="641.0" data-end="642.0"> 
It shows you the complete </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="642.0" data-end="644.0"> 
picture of this resource after </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="644.0" data-end="646.0"> 
it's been created and all of our </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="646.0" data-end="648.0"> 
rules have been applied to it.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="649.0" data-end="650.0"> 
Now if this user accepts, </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="650.0" data-end="651.0"> 
they'll become a user on our </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="652.0" data-end="653.0"> 
And suppose we want to come back </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="653.0" data-end="655.0"> 
later and modify them in some </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="655.0" data-end="657.0"> 
way, like for instance you can </span></span>

this user has the developer </span></span>

role.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="660.0" data-end="661.0"> 
So let's change that so they </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="661.0" data-end="662.0"> 
have the developer and the </span></span>

So we do a PATCH request.</span></span>

The URL this time is the </span></span>

we're changing.</span></span>

anything else about the user, so </span></span>

we specifically didn't include </span></span>

delete it and this is the </span></span>

my colleague Sehoon Shon up to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="730.0" data-end="732.0"> 
show you some examples of how to </span></span>

Hi, everyone.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="744.0" data-end="746.0"> 
My name is Sehoon Shon and I'm a </span></span>

software engineer in TestFlight </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="747.0" data-end="749.0"> 
team and I'm here today to show </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="749.0" data-end="751.0"> 
you the live demo on App Source </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="751.0" data-end="751.0"> 
Connect API.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="753.0" data-end="754.0"> 
We'll look at one use case and </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="754.0" data-end="756.0"> 
see how we can apply the API on </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="756.0" data-end="757.0"> 
users resource.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="758.0" data-end="759.0"> 
Let's say someone in our team </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="759.0" data-end="761.0"> 
has left our company and we'd </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="761.0" data-end="762.0"> 
like to find this user and </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="762.0" data-end="763.0"> 
remove this user from the team </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="764.0" data-end="764.0"> 
in App Source Connect.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="764.0" data-end="765.0"> 
So let's go see a demo.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="781.0" data-end="784.0"> 
We'll begin by getting the list </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="784.0" data-end="785.0"> 
of all the users in our team by </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="785.0" data-end="787.0"> 
sending GET request to the users </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="787.0" data-end="790.0"> 
resource, which is GET v1/users.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="790.0" data-end="792.0"> 
And this returns all the users </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="792.0" data-end="794.0"> 
we have access to in our team.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="795.0" data-end="796.0"> 
Now let's try to find the user </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="796.0" data-end="797.0"> 
we're looking for and we can </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="797.0" data-end="799.0"> 
search by the email of the user </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="799.0" data-end="800.0"> 
by applying the filter </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="800.0" data-end="800.0"> 
parameter.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="801.0" data-end="802.0"> 
So this filter parameter of </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="802.0" data-end="804.0"> 
email specified that we would </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="804.0" data-end="805.0"> 
like to find the users that </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="805.0" data-end="808.0"> 
matches JohnAppleseed@mac.com.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="808.0" data-end="809.0"> 
So let's send this request.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="810.0" data-end="812.0"> 
And we get a response with a </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="812.0" data-end="813.0"> 
user that contains the email of </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="813.0" data-end="814.0"> 
John Appleseed.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="815.0" data-end="819.0"> 
Now let's use the ID of this </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="819.0" data-end="821.0"> 
user to get the instance of this </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="821.0" data-end="826.0"> 
user, which is users/ID and this </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="826.0" data-end="828.0"> 
should return the instance of </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="828.0" data-end="829.0"> 
the user with a matching ID.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="830.0" data-end="833.0"> 
And we get a response with the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="833.0" data-end="834.0"> 
username John Appleseed.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="835.0" data-end="836.0"> 
So we found the user that we're </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="836.0" data-end="837.0"> 
looking for.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="837.0" data-end="839.0"> 
Let's try to remove this user by </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="839.0" data-end="841.0"> 
sending DELETE request to self </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="841.0" data-end="842.0"> 
link of this user.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="843.0" data-end="845.0"> 
So we'll replace GET with </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="845.0" data-end="845.0"> 
DELETE.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="847.0" data-end="848.0"> 
And this should remove the user </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="848.0" data-end="849.0"> 
with the matching ID.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="849.0" data-end="854.0"> 
And we get a 204, which means </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="854.0" data-end="856.0"> 
the deletion was successful and </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="856.0" data-end="858.0"> 
NO CONTENT since the content of </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="858.0" data-end="859.0"> 
user is no longer available.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="860.0" data-end="861.0"> 
Finally, let's confirm that the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="861.0" data-end="863.0"> 
user is indeed removed by </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="863.0" data-end="864.0"> 
sending GET request to the self </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="864.0" data-end="865.0"> 
link once again.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="865.0" data-end="869.0"> 
And now we get 404 NOT FOUND and </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="869.0" data-end="870.0"> 
it looks like the user is indeed </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="870.0" data-end="871.0"> 
removed.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="871.0" data-end="875.0"> 
So in this demo, we saw how to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="875.0" data-end="877.0"> 
get collections of user, how to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="877.0" data-end="880.0"> 
find instance of user, how to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="880.0" data-end="881.0"> 
search user by applying filter, </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="882.0" data-end="883.0"> 
and how to remove user by </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="884.0" data-end="884.0"> 
sending DELETE request.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="885.0" data-end="887.0"> 
And this concludes the demo on </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="887.0" data-end="888.0"> 
how to use App Source Connect </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="888.0" data-end="889.0"> 
API with the users resource.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="890.0" data-end="891.0"> 
And I'll give the stage back to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="891.0" data-end="891.0"> 
Geoff.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="891.0" data-end="891.0"> 
Thank you.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="892.0" data-end="898.0"> 
</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="899.0" data-end="902.0"> 
 Thanks, Sehoon.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="902.0" data-end="904.0"> 
So now you know how to create, </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="904.0" data-end="907.0"> 
read, update, and delete all </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="907.0" data-end="908.0"> 
these various resources and it </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="908.0" data-end="909.0"> 
and might feel like that's </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="909.0" data-end="910.0"> 
basically it, that's all you </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="910.0" data-end="912.0"> 
need to be able to do but isn't </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="912.0" data-end="914.0"> 
the whole story and that brings </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="914.0" data-end="915.0"> 
us to relationships.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="916.0" data-end="916.0"> 
Sometimes it's not the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="916.0" data-end="918.0"> 
individual resources that you're </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="918.0" data-end="919.0"> 
most interested in but the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="919.0" data-end="921.0"> 
connections between them.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="921.0" data-end="922.0"> 
It helps if I give you an </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="922.0" data-end="923.0"> 
example.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="923.0" data-end="925.0"> 
We have a resource called Beta </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="925.0" data-end="925.0"> 
Groups.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="925.0" data-end="927.0"> 
These represent all your groups </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="927.0" data-end="927.0"> 
in TestFlight.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="928.0" data-end="929.0"> 
We have another one called Beta </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="929.0" data-end="931.0"> 
Testers that represent all of </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="931.0" data-end="932.0"> 
the people who can test your </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="932.0" data-end="933.0"> 
applications.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="933.0" data-end="935.0"> 
And as you know, you can put </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="935.0" data-end="936.0"> 
those testers into groups.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="937.0" data-end="938.0"> 
So how do we model something </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="938.0" data-end="940.0"> 
like this in the API? </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="941.0" data-end="942.0"> 
Let's start by getting Beta </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="942.0" data-end="942.0"> 
Groups.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="943.0" data-end="946.0"> 
We go a GET v1/beta Groups and </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="946.0" data-end="947.0"> 
we get back an array of Groups.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="947.0" data-end="948.0"> 
And if we look at the first </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="948.0" data-end="950.0"> 
group and in particular the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="950.0" data-end="952.0"> 
relationship section, we see </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="952.0" data-end="953.0"> 
that this group has three </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="953.0" data-end="955.0"> 
relationships: app, beta </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="955.0" data-end="957.0"> 
testers, and builds.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="957.0" data-end="958.0"> 
We're only going to talk about </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="958.0" data-end="959.0"> 
Beta Testers today.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="959.0" data-end="960.0"> 
So we'll pop that one open.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="961.0" data-end="963.0"> 
And again, we see another links </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="963.0" data-end="963.0"> 
section.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="964.0" data-end="965.0"> 
These are links associated with </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="965.0" data-end="967.0"> 
this beta testers relationship </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="967.0" data-end="969.0"> 
on this first group in the list.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="969.0" data-end="971.0"> 
You'd have a section like this </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="971.0" data-end="972.0"> 
in each of the groups in the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="972.0" data-end="972.0"> 
array.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="973.0" data-end="975.0"> 
There're two links here, the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="975.0" data-end="976.0"> 
first one we call the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="976.0" data-end="977.0"> 
relationship self link.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="978.0" data-end="979.0"> 
And it's a URL that represents </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="979.0" data-end="981.0"> 
the relationship itself.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="982.0" data-end="985.0"> 
And we use this URL to operate </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="985.0" data-end="986.0"> 
on this relationship.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="987.0" data-end="988.0"> 
Now let me explain that.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="989.0" data-end="990.0"> 
We said we want to add testers </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="990.0" data-end="992.0"> 
to this group, right, but I want </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="992.0" data-end="992.0"> 
to be clear.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="992.0" data-end="993.0"> 
The testers are already in </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="993.0" data-end="995.0"> 
TestFlight and the group is </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="995.0" data-end="996.0"> 
already in TestFlight.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="996.0" data-end="997.0"> 
So we want to take these </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="997.0" data-end="999.0"> 
existing testers and put them </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="999.0" data-end="1001.0"> 
into this existing group and </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1001.0" data-end="1003.0"> 
that's a operation that doesn't </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1003.0" data-end="1004.0"> 
fit with any of the things we've </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1004.0" data-end="1005.0"> 
learned about already, if you </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1005.0" data-end="1006.0"> 
think about it, right, like </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1006.0" data-end="1008.0"> 
we're not creating or editing or </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1008.0" data-end="1009.0"> 
deleting testers and we're not </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1009.0" data-end="1011.0"> 
really editing the group either, </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1011.0" data-end="1013.0"> 
at least not the attributes of </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1013.0" data-end="1013.0"> 
the group.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1013.0" data-end="1015.0"> 
So conceptually, you might say </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1015.0" data-end="1016.0"> 
that we're creating new </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1016.0" data-end="1018.0"> 
connections between this group </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1018.0" data-end="1020.0"> 
and its related beta testers.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1020.0" data-end="1020.0"> 
And this is where the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1020.0" data-end="1022.0"> 
relationship self link comes in.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1023.0" data-end="1024.0"> 
It looks like this.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1024.0" data-end="1025.0"> 
We do a POST request to the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1025.0" data-end="1027.0"> 
relationship self link.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1027.0" data-end="1029.0"> 
And if you look at the data </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1029.0" data-end="1030.0"> 
we're sending, it's these type </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1030.0" data-end="1032.0"> 
and id pairs of the two testers </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1032.0" data-end="1033.0"> 
in this case that we want to add </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1033.0" data-end="1034.0"> 
to this group.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1034.0" data-end="1036.0"> 
So this request says take these </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1036.0" data-end="1037.0"> 
two testers and put them into </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1037.0" data-end="1038.0"> 
this group.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1038.0" data-end="1039.0"> 
We don't have to include more </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1039.0" data-end="1040.0"> 
tester information because the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1040.0" data-end="1041.0"> 
testers are already in </span></span>

TestFlight.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1042.0" data-end="1045.0"> 
If we run it, we get a 204 NO </span></span>

CONTENT response again.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1046.0" data-end="1047.0"> 
That's the API telling you that </span></span>

the testers have been added to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1048.0" data-end="1049.0"> 
the group.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1050.0" data-end="1051.0"> 
I'm sure some of you are </span></span>

wondering "What if I want to </span></span>

take testers out of the group </span></span>

instead?" </span></span>

So let's go see the demo.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1246.0" data-end="1248.0"> 
We'll start by creating a new </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1248.0" data-end="1249.0">

When we're creating a resource, </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1255.0" data-end="1256.0"> 
we also need to provide the </span></span>

<p>

We have the data with the type </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1259.0" data-end="1260.0"> 
of beta Groups and a set of </span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1261.0" data-end="1263.0"> 
And since the name is the only </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1263.0" data-end="1264.0"> 
required field when we're </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1264.0" data-end="1266.0"> 
creating a group, let's give it </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1266.0" data-end="1268.0"> 
a name and we'll simply call it </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1269.0" data-end="1269.0"> 
Test Group.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1270.0" data-end="1271.0"> 
And I'll send the request now </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1272.0" data-end="1275.0"> 
and we get a 409 CONFLICT </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1275.0" data-end="1275.0"> 
response.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1275.0" data-end="1278.0"> 
So let's look at the details.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1278.0" data-end="1279.0"> 
It says, "You must provide a </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1279.0" data-end="1281.0"> 
value for the relationship app </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1281.0" data-end="1282.0"> 
with this request." </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1282.0" data-end="1284.0"> 
So in TestFlight, you cannot </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1284.0" data-end="1285.0"> 
create a beta Group that does </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1285.0" data-end="1287.0"> 
not belong to any app and, thus, </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1287.0" data-end="1288.0"> 
we must create a relationship to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1288.0" data-end="1290.0"> 
an app while we're creating beta </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1290.0" data-end="1290.0"> 
Group.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1291.0" data-end="1291.0"> 
And how do we do this? </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1292.0" data-end="1293.0"> 
We can include the relationship </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1293.0" data-end="1297.0"> 
in the payload like this.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1297.0" data-end="1298.0"> 
So now we have the relationship </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1298.0" data-end="1300.0"> 
in the payload of an app with a </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1300.0" data-end="1302.0"> 
data type of apps and the id </span></span>

specifies which apps the beta </span></span>

Groups should be linked to.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1306.0" data-end="1308.0"> 
So this will create beta Groups </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1308.0" data-end="1309.0"> 
with the name of Test Group and </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1309.0" data-end="1312.0"> 
link to an app with the id.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1312.0" data-end="1313.0"> 
So let's resend this request.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1314.0" data-end="1316.0"> 
And now we get a 201 CREATED </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1316.0" data-end="1316.0"> 
response.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1317.0" data-end="1318.0"> 
In the response, we have the id </span></span>

that is generated.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1319.0" data-end="1324.0"> 
So let's copy this id.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1324.0" data-end="1325.0"> 
So we just created a group </span></span>

create beta Groups and beta </span></span>

data, and relationships.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1537.0" data-end="1538.0">

now and talk about how the API </span></span>

Anytime a request fails, you'll </span></span>

this.</span></span>

all that specificity.</span></span>

I'm Julie and I'm an engineer on </span></span>

I'm here today to talk to you </span></span>

about access and authentication.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1734.0" data-end="1736.0"> 
So at this point you've seen a </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1736.0" data-end="1738.0"> 
bunch of different examples of </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1738.0" data-end="1739.0"> 
endpoints that will be </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1739.0" data-end="1740.0"> 
available.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1740.0" data-end="1741.0"> 
And when you're ready to start </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1741.0" data-end="1743.0"> 
testing out some of these new </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1743.0" data-end="1745.0"> 
features, you might start by </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1745.0" data-end="1747.0"> 
sending a simple GET request </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1747.0" data-end="1750.0"> 
like this; however, if you were </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1750.0" data-end="1752.0"> 
to simply curl this endpoint or </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1752.0" data-end="1753.0"> 
type it into your browser, </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1754.0" data-end="1755.0"> 
you'll end up with a response </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1756.0" data-end="1757.0"> 
that looks like this.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1758.0" data-end="1760.0"> 
So as Geoff mentioned, we're </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1760.0" data-end="1762.0"> 
still missing one very important </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1762.0" data-end="1764.0"> 
step stat and that is </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1764.0" data-end="1765.0"> 
authentication credentials.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1766.0" data-end="1769.0"> 
Now this step is necessary for </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1769.0" data-end="1770.0"> 
two reasons.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1771.0" data-end="1773.0"> 
First, authentication </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1773.0" data-end="1775.0"> 
credentials give context to your </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1775.0" data-end="1775.0"> 
request.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1776.0" data-end="1778.0"> 
After all, you don't want all </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1778.0" data-end="1778.0"> 
apps.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1778.0" data-end="1780.0"> 
You want your app.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1780.0" data-end="1782.0"> 
And most importantly, these </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1782.0" data-end="1785.0"> 
credentials secure the API and </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1785.0" data-end="1787.0"> 
ensure that no one but you will </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1787.0" data-end="1788.0"> 
have access to your data.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1789.0" data-end="1793.0"> 
So to add these credentials to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1793.0" data-end="1794.0"> 
your request, you'll need to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1794.0" data-end="1797.0"> 
first create an API Key.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1797.0" data-end="1800.0"> 
You'll then use that key to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1800.0" data-end="1802.0"> 
generate tokens and those tokens </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1802.0" data-end="1804.0"> 
will need to be sent with every </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1804.0" data-end="1804.0"> 
request.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1805.0" data-end="1806.0"> 
So let's start with API Key.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1807.0" data-end="1812.0"> 
Each key is actually a public </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1812.0" data-end="1813.0"> 
key, private key pair.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1814.0" data-end="1816.0"> 
The private key belongs to you </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1817.0" data-end="1818.0"> 
and will be used to add a unique </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1818.0" data-end="1820.0"> 
signature to your token.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1820.0" data-end="1823.0"> 
The public key will be used by </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1824.0" data-end="1826.0"> 
Apple to verify that signature </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1826.0" data-end="1828.0"> 
and ensure that it was in fact </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1828.0" data-end="1830.0"> 
signed by the associated private </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1830.0" data-end="1830.0"> 
key.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1831.0" data-end="1834.0"> 
To create one of the keys, </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1834.0" data-end="1836.0"> 
you'll need to log in to App </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1837.0" data-end="1839.0"> 
Store Connect and navigate to a </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1839.0" data-end="1841.0"> 
new API Keys tab.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1842.0" data-end="1845.0"> 
Your admin users will be able to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1845.0" data-end="1847.0"> 
manage your team's API Keys.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1847.0" data-end="1850.0"> 
You can create new Keys and </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1850.0" data-end="1851.0"> 
revoke them when they're no </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1851.0" data-end="1851.0"> 
longer needed.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1852.0" data-end="1854.0"> 
Each key will need to be </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1854.0" data-end="1856.0"> 
assigned a level of access and </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1857.0" data-end="1859.0"> 
this will determine what API </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1859.0" data-end="1861.0"> 
services the key can be used </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1861.0" data-end="1861.0"> 
for.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1863.0" data-end="1865.0"> 
Once created, new keys will </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1865.0" data-end="1867.0"> 
appear in this list and the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1867.0" data-end="1869.0"> 
private key file, that's the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1869.0" data-end="1870.0"> 
part that belongs to you, will </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1870.0" data-end="1872.0"> 
be available to download.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1873.0" data-end="1875.0"> 
Now it's important to note that </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1876.0" data-end="1877.0"> 
each private key can only be </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1877.0" data-end="1878.0"> 
downloaded once.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1879.0" data-end="1881.0"> 
That is because these keys are </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1881.0" data-end="1882.0"> 
not stored by Apple.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1883.0" data-end="1885.0"> 
In fact, your key is not even </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1885.0" data-end="1887.0"> 
generated until the moment you </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1887.0" data-end="1889.0"> 
decide to download it.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1890.0" data-end="1891.0"> 
So you can think of these keys </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1891.0" data-end="1892.0"> 
like real keys.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1893.0" data-end="1895.0"> 
They belong to you and they must </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1895.0" data-end="1899.0"> 
be managed and protected by you.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1899.0" data-end="1902.0"> 
Also much like real keys, these </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1902.0" data-end="1905.0"> 
keys do not expire, so if the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1905.0" data-end="1907.0"> 
key is lost or stolen it will </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1907.0" data-end="1909.0"> 
continue to have access to your </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1910.0" data-end="1911.0"> 
data until it is revoked through </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1911.0" data-end="1912.0"> 
App Store Connect.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1913.0" data-end="1915.0"> 
So for this reason, it is very </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1915.0" data-end="1917.0"> 
important to keep your keys safe </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1917.0" data-end="1917.0"> 
and secure.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1919.0" data-end="1920.0"> 
Once you have your private key </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1920.0" data-end="1923.0"> 
file, you'll be ready to start </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1923.0" data-end="1924.0"> 
generating JSON web tokens.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1925.0" data-end="1927.0"> 
Now each of these tokens will </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1927.0" data-end="1928.0"> 
need to contain a few pieces of </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1928.0" data-end="1929.0"> 
information.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1930.0" data-end="1932.0"> 
First, you'll need to add your </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1932.0" data-end="1934.0"> 
Issuer ID, that's your account </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1934.0" data-end="1937.0"> 
identifier, and this ID can be </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1937.0" data-end="1938.0"> 
found at the top of that new </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1938.0" data-end="1939.0"> 
page.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1940.0" data-end="1942.0"> 
You'll also need to find or </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1942.0" data-end="1944.0"> 
you'll also need to add the ID </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1944.0" data-end="1945.0"> 
of your key.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1945.0" data-end="1948.0"> 
This ID can also be found on </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1948.0" data-end="1951.0"> 
this new page and it is specific </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1951.0" data-end="1953.0"> 
to the key that you'll be using.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1953.0" data-end="1957.0"> 
Now each token will also need an </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1957.0" data-end="1959.0"> 
expiration timestamp.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1959.0" data-end="1961.0"> 
As I mentioned before, your keys </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1961.0" data-end="1964.0"> 
do not expire but these tokens </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1964.0" data-end="1965.0"> 
can only be used for up to 20 </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1965.0" data-end="1966.0"> 
minutes.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1966.0" data-end="1969.0"> 
And the last two pieces of </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1969.0" data-end="1971.0"> 
information are simply constant.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1971.0" data-end="1974.0"> 
By that, I mean they will remain </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1974.0" data-end="1976.0"> 
the same across all tokens and </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1976.0" data-end="1978.0"> 
for all App Store Connect APIs, </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1979.0" data-end="1980.0"> 
the first is the Audience for </span></span>

the token and that will always </span></span>

be App Store Connect.</span></span>

And finally, you'll need to </span></span>

assign or you'll need to add the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1989.0" data-end="1992.0">

This example behind me is </span></span>

give it a try.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2062.0" data-end="2065.0"> 
Okay, so here's that new API </span></span>

something like finance, I'd get </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2079.0" data-end="2080.0">

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2094.0" data-end="2096.0">

admin.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2097.0" data-end="2099.0"> 
And when I generate my key, I </span></span>

available to download.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2102.0" data-end="2106.0"> 
As I mentioned earlier, my </span></span>

If I lose my key or accidentally </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2110.0" data-end="2112.0"> 
delete it, I can't come back </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2112.0" data-end="2113.0"> 
here to re-download it.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2113.0" data-end="2116.0"> 
So for that reason, I'm prompted </span></span>

to make sure that I'm ready to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2117.0" data-end="2118.0"> 
download this now.</span></span>

And I am, so let's go ahead and </span></span>

download.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2121.0" data-end="2124.0"> 
Now that I have my private key </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2124.0" data-end="2126.0"> 
in my Downloads folder, I can </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2126.0" data-end="2128.0"> 
pull up that script we saw </span></span>

earlier.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2129.0" data-end="2131.0"> 
And I'll need to copy over my </span></span>

ISSUER ID.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2137.0" data-end="2139.0"> 
That's the one that's shared </span></span>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2141.0" data-end="2143.0"> 
And I'll also need to copy that </span></span>

ID of the private key I just </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2144.0" data-end="2144.0"> 
downloaded.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2149.0" data-end="2151.0"> 
And once I have those IDs in </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2151.0" data-end="2153.0"> 
place, my private key will be </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2153.0" data-end="2154.0"> 
loaded in from my Downloads </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2155.0" data-end="2157.0"> 
And I'll generate a new token.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2158.0" data-end="2162.0"> 
So if we pull up the terminal, I </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2162.0" data-end="2166.0"> 
can curl that apps endpoint.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2166.0" data-end="2168.0"> 
And as we expected, we get that </span></span>

401 response.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2169.0" data-end="2170.0"> 
So let's call my script.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2177.0" data-end="2179.0"> 
And I get a new token.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2180.0" data-end="2182.0"> 
So I can take that token and add </span></span>

it to my request </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2188.0" data-end="2190.0"> 
by putting it in an </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2190.0" data-end="2191.0"> 
authorization header.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2191.0" data-end="2192.0"> 
Make sure I spelled that right.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2198.0" data-end="2199.0"> 
And I get back the list of my </span></span>

</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2205.0" data-end="2207.0"> 
So as you can see, with just a </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2207.0" data-end="2210.0"> 
few easy steps I was able to get </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2210.0" data-end="2212.0"> 
access to the API and start </span></span>

Thanks, Julie.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2224.0" data-end="2225.0"> 
Pretty cool, huh? </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2226.0" data-end="2227.0"> 
So that's access and </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2227.0" data-end="2228.0"> 
authentication.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2228.0" data-end="2229.0"> 
And now in the few minutes that </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2229.0" data-end="2231.0"> 
we have remaining, I want to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2231.0" data-end="2232.0"> 
talk about some best practices </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2232.0" data-end="2233.0"> 
when using the API.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2234.0" data-end="2235.0"> 
We're going to start with those </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2235.0" data-end="2235.0"> 
keys.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2236.0" data-end="2237.0"> 
Now as Julie said, those keys </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2237.0" data-end="2239.0"> 
belong to you and it's your job </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2239.0" data-end="2240.0"> 
to protect them.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2240.0" data-end="2242.0"> 
Anybody who has the keys can </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2242.0" data-end="2243.0"> 
access your data.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2243.0" data-end="2244.0"> 
So ideally, you're going to put </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2244.0" data-end="2246.0"> 
those keys in some kind of a </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2246.0" data-end="2247.0"> 
secure key store and your code </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2247.0" data-end="2249.0"> 
will check them out, use them in </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2249.0" data-end="2251.0"> 
memory, and never store them </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2251.0" data-end="2252.0"> 
anywhere, like in a database or </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2252.0" data-end="2253.0"> 
on disc.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2253.0" data-end="2254.0"> 
If you do have to store the keys </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2254.0" data-end="2256.0"> 
on disc, make sure you check </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2256.0" data-end="2257.0"> 
your file system permissions </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2257.0" data-end="2258.0"> 
very carefully.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2259.0" data-end="2260.0"> 
And, of course, if you have any </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2260.0" data-end="2261.0"> 
reason to think a key has been </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2261.0" data-end="2262.0"> 
compromised in some way, </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2262.0" data-end="2264.0"> 
immediately log in to App Store </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2264.0" data-end="2267.0"> 
Connect and revoke that key.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2267.0" data-end="2268.0"> 
I also want to talk about the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2268.0" data-end="2270.0"> 
tokens that you create from your </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2270.0" data-end="2271.0"> 
keys.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2271.0" data-end="2271.0"> 
Now there's no reason that you </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2271.0" data-end="2273.0"> 
have to send a different token </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2273.0" data-end="2274.0"> 
with every request.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2274.0" data-end="2275.0"> 
In fact, you'll get better </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2275.0" data-end="2276.0"> 
performance in your code and on </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2276.0" data-end="2278.0"> 
our end if you reuse those </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2278.0" data-end="2280.0"> 
tokens over and over again.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2280.0" data-end="2281.0"> 
And usually this is really easy, </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2282.0" data-end="2282.0"> 
right.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2282.0" data-end="2283.0"> 
You just generate a token at the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2283.0" data-end="2285.0"> 
top of the script, send it with </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2285.0" data-end="2286.0"> 
every request until you're </span></span>

finished.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2287.0" data-end="2288.0"> 
And we let you control the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2288.0" data-end="2289.0"> 
expiration time because you're </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2289.0" data-end="2291.0"> 
the best person to know how long </span></span>

it should last, long enough to </span></span>

significantly longer than it </span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2297.0" data-end="2298.0"> 
Of course, you might have </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2298.0" data-end="2300.0"> 
processes that run for longer </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2300.0" data-end="2301.0"> 
than 20 minutes or run </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2301.0" data-end="2302.0"> 
continuously and when that's the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2302.0" data-end="2303.0"> 
case you'll want to structure </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2303.0" data-end="2304.0"> 
your code a little differently.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2305.0" data-end="2306.0"> 
Maybe you'll generate a </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2306.0" data-end="2308.0"> 
20-minute token and use it as </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2308.0" data-end="2309.0"> 
needed and then throw it away </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2309.0" data-end="2311.0"> 
and issue a new one before the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2311.0" data-end="2312.0"> 
old one expires, say every 18 </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2312.0" data-end="2313.0"> 
minutes.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2313.0" data-end="2314.0"> 
That way, you're getting maximum </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2336.0" data-end="2337.0"> 
When you're doing a multistep </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2337.0" data-end="2339.0"> 
process, whenever possible take </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2339.0" data-end="2341.0"> 
the link we gave you out of the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2341.0" data-end="2343.0"> 
response and use it for the next </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2343.0" data-end="2343.0"> 
part of the process.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2344.0" data-end="2345.0"> 
This will help you in two ways.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2345.0" data-end="2347.0"> 
One, it makes your code more </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2347.0" data-end="2348.0"> 
generically applicable to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2348.0" data-end="2349.0"> 
different parts of the API.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2349.0" data-end="2351.0"> 
And two, when that inevitable v2 </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2351.0" data-end="2353.0"> 
API comes along, this will </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2353.0" data-end="2354.0"> 
reduce the amount of work you </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2354.0" data-end="2356.0"> 
have to do to adjust to the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2356.0" data-end="2357.0"> 
changes.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2358.0" data-end="2359.0"> 
And finally, I want to talk </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2359.0" data-end="2360.0"> 
about the documentation.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2362.0" data-end="2363.0"> 
We've talked about the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2363.0" data-end="2364.0"> 
consistency of this API today </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2364.0" data-end="2366.0"> 
and we really focused on that.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2366.0" data-end="2367.0"> 
And so any time a resource can </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2367.0" data-end="2368.0"> 
do something, it will do it in </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2368.0" data-end="2370.0"> 
the same way as all the other </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2370.0" data-end="2372.0"> 
resources but of course not </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2372.0" data-end="2373.0"> 
every resource can do </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2373.0" data-end="2374.0"> 
everything.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2374.0" data-end="2375.0"> 
You already saw an example of </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2375.0" data-end="2376.0"> 
this with users.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2376.0" data-end="2377.0"> 
We had to create an invitation.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2377.0" data-end="2379.0"> 
There's no API to create a user.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2379.0" data-end="2381.0"> 
So the documentation is how you </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2381.0" data-end="2381.0"> 
figure this out.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2381.0" data-end="2383.0"> 
It tells you what the resource </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2383.0" data-end="2385.0"> 
can do, what operations are </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2385.0" data-end="2386.0"> 
available, what parameters it </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2386.0" data-end="2387.0"> 
supports, and so forth.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2388.0" data-end="2390.0"> 
And that's the App Store Connect </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2390.0" data-end="2390.0"> 
API.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2391.0" data-end="2392.0"> 
It's a consistent </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2392.0" data-end="2393.0"> 
standards-based REST API.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2394.0" data-end="2395.0"> 
We're really excited about it.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2395.0" data-end="2397.0"> 
And one thing that we love about </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2397.0" data-end="2399.0"> 
this API is that we designed it </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2399.0" data-end="2400.0"> 
to be really flexible so that </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2400.0" data-end="2401.0"> 
you can take App Store Connect </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2402.0" data-end="2403.0"> 
and you can put it into your </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2403.0" data-end="2405.0"> 
workflow into the way that you </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2405.0" data-end="2406.0"> 
work and using the tools that </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2406.0" data-end="2407.0"> 
you like best.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2407.0" data-end="2408.0"> 
We're really excited for you to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2408.0" data-end="2409.0"> 
start doing that.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2410.0" data-end="2411.0"> 
It'll be available to all app </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2411.0" data-end="2412.0"> 
developers this summer.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2413.0" data-end="2414.0"> 
And I know you guys have </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2414.0" data-end="2415.0"> 
questions, so come and see us in </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2415.0" data-end="2416.0"> 
the App Store Connect Lab.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2416.0" data-end="2417.0"> 
It's actually happening right </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2417.0" data-end="2418.0">

So we'll head down there as soon </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2419.0" data-end="2420.0"> 
as I stop talking and we can </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2420.0" data-end="2421.0"> 
answer those questions.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2421.0" data-end="2423.0"> 
We have a lab tomorrow as well </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2423.0" data-end="2425.0"> 
at 1:00 p.m. and also check out </span></span>

It had some more about the API </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2429.0" data-end="2430.0"> 
and about App Store Connect </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2431.0" data-end="2433.0">
