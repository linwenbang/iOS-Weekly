So today, when we talk about </span></span>

building faster in Xcode, we're </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="64.0" data-end="65.0">

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="67.0" data-end="70.0"> 
The first is going to be around </span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="72.0" data-end="75.0"> 
And the second, it'll be about </span></span>

reducing the amount of work that </span></span>

how to parallelize your build </span></span>

Now, Jordan is going to be </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="99.0" data-end="100.0"> 
walking us through some of the </span></span>

source-level improvements that </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="101.0" data-end="103.0">

including understanding our </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="104.0" data-end="105.0">

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="114.0" data-end="115.0"> 
So let's talk about </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="115.0" data-end="116.0"> 
parallelizing your build.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="116.0" data-end="118.0"> 
Now, Xcode configures your </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="118.0" data-end="120.0"> 
projects through the use of </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="120.0" data-end="120.0"> 
targets.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="121.0" data-end="124.0"> 
And targets specify the output </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="126.0" data-end="127.0"> 
Some examples are iOS app, </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="128.0" data-end="130.0"> 
framework, and unit tests.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="131.0" data-end="132.0"> 
Now, there's another piece of </span></span>

information, that's the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="136.0" data-end="137.0"> 
And Xcode provides us two ways </span></span>

to define our dependencies.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="139.0" data-end="141.0"> 
There's an explicit means, which </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="144.0" data-end="145.0">

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="148.0" data-end="148.0"> 
phase.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="148.0" data-end="149.0"> 
And we'll be taking a look at </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="149.0" data-end="152.0"> 
those more in depth in just a </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="152.0" data-end="152.0"> 
few moments.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="153.0" data-end="154.0"> 
Now, throughout this section I </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="154.0" data-end="155.0"> 
want to use a sample project to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="155.0" data-end="156.0"> 
ground our discussion.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="157.0" data-end="158.0"> 
And so we're going to take a </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="158.0" data-end="160.0"> 
look at a dependency graph for </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="160.0" data-end="160.0"> 
that project.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="161.0" data-end="163.0"> 
Now, a dependency graph is </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="163.0" data-end="165.0"> 
simply a listing of all of the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="165.0" data-end="166.0"> 
targets.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="166.0" data-end="167.0"> 
And this case we're going to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="167.0" data-end="168.0"> 
have five targets that we're </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="168.0" data-end="168.0"> 
going to be building.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="170.0" data-end="171.0"> 
And it has that dependency </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="171.0" data-end="172.0"> 
information between those </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="172.0" data-end="173.0"> 
targets.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="174.0" data-end="175.0"> 
And based on these two pieces of </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="175.0" data-end="178.0"> 
information Xcode can derive our </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="178.0" data-end="179.0"> 
build order.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="179.0" data-end="181.0"> 
Now, let's take a look at what </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="181.0" data-end="182.0"> 
this looks like on a timeline </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="182.0" data-end="183.0"> 
graph.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="183.0" data-end="188.0"> 
So as we can see, each of these </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="188.0" data-end="189.0"> 
targets are building in in </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="189.0" data-end="190.0"> 
order, sequentially.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="191.0" data-end="192.0"> 
And they each have to wait until </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="192.0" data-end="193.0"> 
the previous target is done </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="193.0" data-end="194.0"> 
building.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="194.0" data-end="196.0"> 
Now, there's nothing wrong with </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="196.0" data-end="197.0"> 
this build timeline, per se.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="198.0" data-end="200.0"> 
But it does represent a waste of </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="200.0" data-end="202.0"> 
potential hardware utilization, </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="202.0" data-end="203.0"> 
especially if you have a </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="203.0" data-end="204.0"> 
multi-core or a mini-core </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="204.0" data-end="205.0"> 
machine like an iMac Pro.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="206.0" data-end="208.0"> 
And what that means to you is a </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="208.0" data-end="209.0"> 
waste of time as a developer.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="210.0" data-end="212.0"> 
So instead, we want to move to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="212.0" data-end="214.0"> 
something that looks more like </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="217.0" data-end="217.0"> 
this.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="217.0" data-end="218.0"> 
Now, there's a couple things -- </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="218.0" data-end="219.0"> 
or a few things I want to note </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="219.0" data-end="220.0"> 
about this.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="220.0" data-end="222.0"> 
First, the amount of work that </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="222.0" data-end="223.0"> 
we actually did in building our </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="223.0" data-end="225.0"> 
project, it did not change.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="226.0" data-end="228.0"> 
However, the time to build did </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="228.0" data-end="229.0"> 
decrease.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="230.0" data-end="231.0"> 
And in this case, it actually </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="231.0" data-end="232.0"> 
decreased by a fairly </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="232.0" data-end="233.0"> 
significant margin.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="233.0" data-end="236.0"> 
And we were able to decrease our </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="236.0" data-end="237.0"> 
build time by making better </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="237.0" data-end="239.0"> 
utilization of the hardware that </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="239.0" data-end="242.0"> 
we have available to us.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="242.0" data-end="244.0"> 
So, if parallelization -- or </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="244.0" data-end="247.0"> 
parallelization is such a good </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="247.0" data-end="249.0"> 
thing, why don't we just create </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="249.0" data-end="250.0"> 
a build graph that looks like </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="250.0" data-end="250.0"> 
this? </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="250.0" data-end="251.0"> 
We just build everything at once </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="251.0" data-end="253.0"> 
up front in our build timeline.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="254.0" data-end="256.0"> 
Well, in the best case, you're </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="256.0" data-end="257.0"> 
going to deterministic build </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="257.0" data-end="258.0"> 
errors.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="259.0" data-end="260.0"> 
And this because that dependency </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="260.0" data-end="262.0"> 
information is actually a vital </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="262.0" data-end="263.0"> 
part of your project </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="263.0" data-end="264.0"> 
configuration.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="264.0" data-end="265.0"> 
And when it's set up like this, </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="266.0" data-end="268.0"> 
you're trying to build, for </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="268.0" data-end="269.0"> 
example, your game target before </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="269.0" data-end="271.0"> 
you've built your dependencies.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="271.0" data-end="272.0"> 
So, this is not a good state to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="272.0" data-end="272.0"> 
be in.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="274.0" data-end="275.0"> 
So, how do we get there? </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="275.0" data-end="277.0"> 
How do we get from the long, </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="277.0" data-end="279.0"> 
serialized build timeline to the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="279.0" data-end="283.0"> 
better parallelized build time? </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="284.0" data-end="285.0"> 
Well first, we need to make sure </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="285.0" data-end="288.0"> 
that Xcode is actually set up </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="288.0" data-end="289.0"> 
and configured to allow our </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="289.0" data-end="291.0"> 
targets to be built in parallel.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="291.0" data-end="292.0"> 
And we do that through the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="292.0" data-end="293.0"> 
Scheme Editor.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="293.0" data-end="294.0"> 
You can get to the Scheme Editor </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="294.0" data-end="296.0"> 
by opening the Scheme Chooser </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="297.0" data-end="298.0"> 
and selecting Edit Scheme.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="298.0" data-end="300.0"> 
And specifically, you'll need to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="300.0" data-end="301.0"> 
look at the Build Action.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="302.0" data-end="305.0"> 
And in there, the Build Options.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="305.0" data-end="306.0"> 
Now, there are two listed here.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="307.0" data-end="308.0"> 
The first is Parallelize Build.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="308.0" data-end="310.0"> 
And the second is Find Implicit </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="310.0" data-end="311.0"> 
Dependencies.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="312.0" data-end="313.0"> 
You'll want to check Parallelize </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="313.0" data-end="314.0"> 
Build.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="314.0" data-end="316.0"> 
This will allow Xcode to use the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="316.0" data-end="317.0"> 
dependency information across </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="317.0" data-end="319.0"> 
your targets so that it can </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="319.0" data-end="320.0"> 
attempt to build your targets in </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="320.0" data-end="321.0"> 
parallel.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="321.0" data-end="324.0"> 
So let's look at how your </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="324.0" data-end="325.0"> 
dependencies are actually </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="325.0" data-end="327.0"> 
configured within Xcode.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="328.0" data-end="329.0"> 
This is done through the Build </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="329.0" data-end="330.0"> 
Phase Editor.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="330.0" data-end="331.0"> 
And you can get to the Build </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="331.0" data-end="333.0"> 
Phase Editor by going to your </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="333.0" data-end="335.0"> 
Project Navigator and selecting </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="335.0" data-end="336.0"> 
your project.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="336.0" data-end="337.0"> 
In this case we're looking at </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="337.0" data-end="339.0"> 
the Game Target -- or the Game </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="339.0" data-end="339.0"> 
Project.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="340.0" data-end="343.0"> 
Next, you want to click on Build </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="343.0" data-end="343.0"> 
Phases.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="344.0" data-end="346.0"> 
So, let's take a look at the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="346.0" data-end="346.0"> 
Game Target.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="346.0" data-end="347.0"> 
This is the Build Phase Editor </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="347.0" data-end="348.0"> 
for our Game Target.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="348.0" data-end="350.0"> 
And we're going to look at how </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="350.0" data-end="351.0"> 
its dependencies are configured.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="352.0" data-end="352.0"> 
And I want to call your </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="352.0" data-end="354.0"> 
attention first to the Link </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="355.0" data-end="357.0"> 
Binary with Libraries phase.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="357.0" data-end="359.0"> 
Now, this is the phase of your </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="359.0" data-end="360.0"> 
build process where you define </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="360.0" data-end="361.0"> 
all of the items that you would </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="361.0" data-end="363.0"> 
like to link with your target.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="364.0" data-end="366.0"> 
In this case I have two items.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="366.0" data-end="368.0"> 
I have Physics and Utilities.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="368.0" data-end="371.0"> 
Now, these are targets within </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="371.0" data-end="372.0"> 
our project and our workspace.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="373.0" data-end="374.0"> 
So Xcode can create an implicit </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="374.0" data-end="376.0"> 
dependency on those targets.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="377.0" data-end="379.0"> 
If you're using other linking </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="379.0" data-end="382.0"> 
features such as Autolink or the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="382.0" data-end="383.0"> 
other LD Build Flags build </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="383.0" data-end="385.0"> 
setting, those are not going to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="385.0" data-end="387.0"> 
be made available to you here </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="387.0" data-end="387.0"> 
implicitly.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="388.0" data-end="389.0"> 
So you either have to make an </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="389.0" data-end="390.0"> 
explicit dependency in this </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="390.0" data-end="393.0"> 
build phase, or in the Target </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="393.0" data-end="394.0"> 
Dependencies build phase.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="395.0" data-end="397.0"> 
So you can see here that we have </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="397.0" data-end="398.0"> 
another item here called </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="398.0" data-end="399.0"> 
Shaders.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="399.0" data-end="402.0"> 
And Shaders is something that is </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="402.0" data-end="403.0"> 
not used at link time, but </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="403.0" data-end="405.0"> 
instead it's used by another </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="405.0" data-end="407.0"> 
build phase within our current </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="407.0" data-end="407.0"> 
target.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="408.0" data-end="409.0"> 
So it's important that we let </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="409.0" data-end="410.0"> 
Xcode know that this is a </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="410.0" data-end="412.0"> 
dependency and that we need to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="412.0" data-end="414.0"> 
wait for the Shaders to finish </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="414.0" data-end="417.0"> 
its compilation and build before </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="417.0" data-end="417.0"> 
we can actually build the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="417.0" data-end="418.0"> 
current target we're on.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="419.0" data-end="422.0"> 
Now, this target actually exists </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="422.0" data-end="423.0"> 
in a different project.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="423.0" data-end="425.0"> 
And if you would like to make a </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="425.0" data-end="426.0"> 
reference to that project you </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="426.0" data-end="428.0"> 
can do so by dragging the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="428.0" data-end="430.0"> 
project as a child of the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="430.0" data-end="431.0"> 
current project you're working </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="431.0" data-end="431.0"> 
in.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="431.0" data-end="433.0"> 
So I want to walk through the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="433.0" data-end="434.0"> 
rest of the dependencies of our </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="434.0" data-end="435.0"> 
project.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="436.0" data-end="437.0"> 
Our Shaders target has a </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="437.0" data-end="439.0"> 
dependency on our Utilities </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="439.0" data-end="439.0"> 
target.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="440.0" data-end="442.0"> 
Our Utilities target has a </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="442.0" data-end="443.0"> 
dependency on our Physics </span></span>

target.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="445.0" data-end="447.0"> 
And lastly, our Tests have a </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="447.0" data-end="450.0"> 
dependency on our Shaders and </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="450.0" data-end="451.0"> 
our Utilities targets.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="452.0" data-end="453.0"> 
So now that we have an </span></span>

understanding of the </span></span>

let's look at the steps that are </span></span>

one that we can build more in </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="463.0" data-end="463.0"> 
parallel.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="464.0" data-end="465.0"> 
And we're going to start by </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="465.0" data-end="466.0"> 
looking at our test </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="466.0" data-end="466.0"> 
dependencies.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="468.0" data-end="470.0"> 
Now, I've broken down the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="470.0" data-end="471.0"> 
dependencies into three </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="471.0" data-end="472.0"> 
different classes of </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="472.0" data-end="473.0"> 
dependencies that I want to talk </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="473.0" data-end="473.0"> 
about.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="474.0" data-end="475.0"> 
This first dependency is the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="475.0" data-end="477.0"> 
dependency that I call the "Do </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="477.0" data-end="478.0"> 
Everything" dependency.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="479.0" data-end="480.0"> 
Right? It should a little bit </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="480.0" data-end="481.0"> 
clear here that this test is </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="482.0" data-end="483.0"> 
testing way too many components.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="484.0" data-end="485.0"> 
It's testing our Game.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="485.0" data-end="486.0"> 
It's testing our Shaders.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="487.0" data-end="488.0"> 
And it's testing our Utilities.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="490.0" data-end="491.0"> 
Now in this case, it'd be better </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="491.0" data-end="493.0"> 
to simply break up our tests so </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="493.0" data-end="494.0"> 
that it's testing each </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="494.0" data-end="495.0"> 
individual component.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="495.0" data-end="497.0"> 
And we're going to see by doing </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="497.0" data-end="498.0"> 
this, we're going to introduce </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="498.0" data-end="500.0"> 
our first bit of parallelism </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="500.0" data-end="501.0"> 
into our build process.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="503.0" data-end="505.0"> 
Right? Our test target, which </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="505.0" data-end="506.0"> 
was built in all three can now </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="506.0" data-end="507.0"> 
build just the component that </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="507.0" data-end="508.0"> 
it's looking for in the Game </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="508.0" data-end="509.0"> 
tests.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="510.0" data-end="511.0"> 
And then our Shaders tests and </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="511.0" data-end="513.0"> 
our Utilities tests can be moved </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="513.0" data-end="514.0"> 
to be built in parallel with our </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="514.0" data-end="515.0"> 
other targets.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="516.0" data-end="517.0"> 
And they can be built as soon as </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="517.0" data-end="518.0"> 
their respective components are </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="518.0" data-end="520.0"> 
done, Shaders and Utilities.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="522.0" data-end="524.0"> 
Now, the next type of dependency </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="524.0" data-end="526.0"> 
I want to look at is the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="526.0" data-end="528.0"> 
dependency that I call the "Nosy </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="528.0" data-end="529.0"> 
Neighbors." </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="529.0" data-end="531.0"> 
This is the dependency that </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="531.0" data-end="533.0"> 
needs to exist.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="533.0" data-end="534.0"> 
It's look at another target.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="535.0" data-end="536.0"> 
But it only needs a little bit </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="536.0" data-end="537.0"> 
of that target.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="537.0" data-end="539.0"> 
But instead it's getting </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="539.0" data-end="540.0"> 
everything that's in that </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="540.0" data-end="540.0"> 
target.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="541.0" data-end="542.0"> 
So if we look at our game, it </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="542.0" data-end="544.0"> 
has a dependency on Physics, </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="544.0" data-end="545.0"> 
Shaders, and Utilities.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="546.0" data-end="546.0"> 
This is actually okay.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="548.0" data-end="549.0"> 
The suspect one is the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="549.0" data-end="551.0"> 
dependency between our Shaders </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="551.0" data-end="553.0"> 
target and our Utilities target.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="553.0" data-end="555.0"> 
Now, our Shaders target produces </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="555.0" data-end="556.0"> 
a meta library, which is </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="556.0" data-end="558.0"> 
essentially just a bundle of GPU </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="558.0" data-end="559.0"> 
code that's going to run on our </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="559.0" data-end="560.0"> 
graphics card.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="561.0" data-end="563.0"> 
And our Utilities target just </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="563.0" data-end="564.0"> 
produces a normal frame, which </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="564.0" data-end="565.0"> 
is just CPU code.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="565.0" data-end="566.0"> 
So there's already a little bit </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="566.0" data-end="568.0"> 
of a suspect dependency here.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="569.0" data-end="570.0"> 
When we dig into it we see that </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="570.0" data-end="572.0"> 
the utilities target actually </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="572.0" data-end="574.0"> 
has a build phase in it that's </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="574.0" data-end="576.0"> 
generating some information </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="576.0" data-end="577.0"> 
that's used by both targets.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="577.0" data-end="578.0"> 
Which is totally fine.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="579.0" data-end="580.0"> 
It's just that Shaders doesn't </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="580.0" data-end="582.0"> 
need anything else from the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="582.0" data-end="582.0"> 
Utilities target.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="583.0" data-end="586.0"> 
So it's best to break out that </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="586.0" data-end="587.0"> 
into its own target.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="588.0" data-end="589.0"> 
And we're going to see that this </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="589.0" data-end="590.0"> 
small incremental change </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="590.0" data-end="592.0"> 
actually has a large and </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="592.0" data-end="593.0"> 
significant impact on our </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="593.0" data-end="594.0"> 
overall build timeline.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="596.0" data-end="598.0"> 
So the new green box that just </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="598.0" data-end="599.0"> 
moved in is our new code target.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="600.0" data-end="601.0"> 
So we were able to shrink our </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="601.0" data-end="603.0"> 
utilities target down because we </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="603.0" data-end="605.0"> 
moved that work into Code Gen.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="606.0" data-end="607.0"> 
And since Code Gen has no other </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="607.0" data-end="609.0"> 
dependencies, it can move to the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="609.0" data-end="611.0"> 
very front of our build process.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="611.0" data-end="613.0"> 
It can also be built in parallel </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="613.0" data-end="614.0"> 
with our Physics target, which </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="614.0" data-end="615.0"> 
is the red box on the bottom.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="617.0" data-end="618.0"> 
And lastly, because Shaders no </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="618.0" data-end="620.0"> 
longer depends on Utilities, it </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="620.0" data-end="621.0"> 
doesn't have to wait for both </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="621.0" data-end="624.0"> 
Utilities and the Physics target </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="624.0" data-end="625.0"> 
to be built.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="625.0" data-end="626.0"> 
And instead it can be built as </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="626.0" data-end="629.0"> 
soon as that Code Gen target is </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="630.0" data-end="630.0"> 
done.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="630.0" data-end="631.0"> 
Now, the last dependency I want </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="631.0" data-end="633.0"> 
to talk to you about are the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="633.0" data-end="634.0"> 
ones that I call the "Forgotten </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="634.0" data-end="635.0"> 
Ones." </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="635.0" data-end="637.0"> 
Throughout the evolution or the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="637.0" data-end="640.0"> 
lifecycle of our products and </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="640.0" data-end="642.0"> 
our code, we tend to move code </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="642.0" data-end="644.0"> 
around and delete things.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="644.0" data-end="645.0"> 
And we get things like dead </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="645.0" data-end="645.0"> 
code.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="645.0" data-end="647.0"> 
Well, we get the same thing that </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="647.0" data-end="648.0"> 
happens with our dependencies.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="648.0" data-end="649.0"> 
Sometimes we simply forget to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="649.0" data-end="650.0"> 
clean them up.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="651.0" data-end="652.0"> 
And so in these cases, it's </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="652.0" data-end="654.0"> 
actually safe to just remove </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="654.0" data-end="654.0"> 
that dependency.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="656.0" data-end="658.0"> 
And this last change tightens up </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="658.0" data-end="660.0"> 
or build graph even further by </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="660.0" data-end="663.0"> 
allowing the Utilities target to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="663.0" data-end="664.0"> 
be built right after the Code </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="664.0" data-end="666.0"> 
Gen target instead of having to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="666.0" data-end="667.0"> 
wait for all of the Physics </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="667.0" data-end="671.0"> 
target to be done.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="671.0" data-end="673.0"> 
Now, previously in Xcode, when </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="673.0" data-end="675.0"> 
you built targets that have a </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="675.0" data-end="676.0"> 
dependency on another target, </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="676.0" data-end="678.0"> 
you have to wait for the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="678.0" data-end="679.0"> 
dependent target to finish its </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="679.0" data-end="681.0"> 
entire build process.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="681.0" data-end="683.0"> 
Well, we have a new feature in </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="683.0" data-end="684.0"> 
Xcode 10 that allows us to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="684.0" data-end="687.0"> 
introduce some parallelism into </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="687.0" data-end="688.0"> 
your build for free.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="688.0" data-end="692.0"> 
And we do this by starting the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="692.0" data-end="694.0"> 
compilation of your target as </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="694.0" data-end="696.0"> 
soon as the build phases that go </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="696.0" data-end="698.0"> 
into its dependencies that </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="698.0" data-end="700.0"> 
satisfy our compilation are </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="700.0" data-end="700.0"> 
complete.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="701.0" data-end="702.0"> 
So things like linking can now </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="702.0" data-end="703.0"> 
be done in parallel.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="705.0" data-end="707.0"> 
Now, if you have run script </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="707.0" data-end="709.0"> 
phases, this is one of those </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="709.0" data-end="710.0"> 
build phases that your target is </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="710.0" data-end="713.0"> 
going to have to wait on to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="713.0" data-end="714.0"> 
finish in order before it can </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="714.0" data-end="716.0"> 
start taking advantage of some </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="716.0" data-end="718.0"> 
of these new parallelization </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="718.0" data-end="718.0"> 
benefits.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="718.0" data-end="721.0"> 
So let's talk about run script </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="721.0" data-end="721.0"> 
phases.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="722.0" data-end="724.0"> 
Run script phases allow you to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="724.0" data-end="725.0"> 
customize your build process to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="725.0" data-end="726.0"> 
meet your needs.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="727.0" data-end="728.0"> 
And so with this flexibility </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="728.0" data-end="730.0"> 
comes some responsibility for </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="730.0" data-end="731.0"> 
you as a developer as well.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="732.0" data-end="733.0"> 
And so we want to walk you </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="733.0" data-end="734.0"> 
through the configuration </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="734.0" data-end="735.0"> 
process and make sure that you </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="735.0" data-end="737.0"> 
have your run script phases set </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="737.0" data-end="738.0"> 
up and configured well so that </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="738.0" data-end="739.0"> 
your builds behave.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="742.0" data-end="744.0"> 
Now, this is your Script Phase </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="744.0" data-end="744.0"> 
Editor.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="745.0" data-end="746.0"> 
It can also be found within your </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="747.0" data-end="748.0"> 
Now I want to call your </span></span>

attention to first the script </span></span>

body here.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="752.0" data-end="753.0"> 
You can either put your entire </span></span>

script contents here.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="754.0" data-end="756.0"> 
Or you can do what I've done and </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="756.0" data-end="757.0"> 
reference another script that's </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="759.0" data-end="760.0"> 
Now, throughout the entirety of </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="760.0" data-end="762.0"> 
your run script phase, there are </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="762.0" data-end="763.0"> 
a set of build settings that are </span></span>

to not have to provide absolute </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="772.0" data-end="774.0"> 
paths or try to do some relative </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="774.0" data-end="775.0"> 
path hacks to get your stuff to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="775.0" data-end="776.0"> 
work.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="777.0" data-end="779.0"> 
The next section are you input </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="779.0" data-end="780.0"> 
files.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="780.0" data-end="782.0"> 
Now, these are very important </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="782.0" data-end="783.0"> 
for your run script phase.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="783.0" data-end="785.0"> 
As this is one of the key pieces </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="785.0" data-end="787.0"> 
of information that the Xcode </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="787.0" data-end="788.0"> 
Build System will use to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="788.0" data-end="789.0"> 
determine if your run scripts </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="789.0" data-end="792.0"> 
should actually run or not.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="792.0" data-end="793.0"> 
So this should include any file </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="793.0" data-end="795.0"> 
that your run script phase, the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="796.0" data-end="797.0"> 
script content, is actually </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="797.0" data-end="798.0"> 
going to read or look at during </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="798.0" data-end="799.0"> 
its process.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="801.0" data-end="803.0"> 
Now, some of you may have a lot </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="803.0" data-end="805.0"> 
of inputs into your run script </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="805.0" data-end="805.0"> 
phase.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="805.0" data-end="807.0"> 
And so this task might seem a </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="807.0" data-end="807.0"> 
little bit daunting.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="808.0" data-end="811.0"> 
And so new in Xcode 10 we have </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="811.0" data-end="812.0"> 
the ability for you -- or we've </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="812.0" data-end="813.0"> 
provided you the ability to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="813.0" data-end="814.0"> 
maintain this list in an </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="814.0" data-end="817.0"> 
external file, something we call </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="817.0" data-end="818.0"> 
a File List.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="819.0" data-end="821.0"> 
Now, a file list is a simple </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="821.0" data-end="822.0"> 
text file that has all of its </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="822.0" data-end="824.0"> 
inputs listed on its own line.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="826.0" data-end="827.0"> 
You get access to all of the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="827.0" data-end="828.0"> 
same build settings that were </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="828.0" data-end="829.0"> 
available to you throughout the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="829.0" data-end="831.0"> 
context of your run script </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="831.0" data-end="831.0"> 
phase.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="832.0" data-end="833.0"> 
The important thing to note </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="833.0" data-end="834.0"> 
here, though, is that these </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="834.0" data-end="836.0"> 
files cannot be modified or </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="836.0" data-end="837.0"> 
generated throughout your build </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="837.0" data-end="838.0"> 
process.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="838.0" data-end="840.0"> 
They are read when your build </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="840.0" data-end="841.0"> 
process starts.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="842.0" data-end="843.0"> 
And all that information is used </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="843.0" data-end="843.0"> 
then.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="843.0" data-end="847.0"> 
Next I want to talk to you about </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="847.0" data-end="848.0"> 
your output files.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="848.0" data-end="849.0"> 
Your output files are another </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="849.0" data-end="850.0"> 
key piece of information that's </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="850.0" data-end="851.0"> 
used throughout your build </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="851.0" data-end="852.0"> 
process.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="853.0" data-end="854.0"> 
And Xcode will use this </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="854.0" data-end="855.0"> 
information to determine if your </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="855.0" data-end="857.0"> 
run script phase actually needs </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="857.0" data-end="857.0"> 
to run.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="857.0" data-end="860.0"> 
And of course, we have support </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="860.0" data-end="863.0"> 
for output files -- or file </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="863.0" data-end="864.0"> 
lists for your output files as </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="864.0" data-end="864.0"> 
well.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="865.0" data-end="867.0"> 
So I want to recap for you when </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="867.0" data-end="868.0"> 
your run script phase is </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="868.0" data-end="868.0"> 
actually run.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="869.0" data-end="871.0"> 
If you have no input files </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="871.0" data-end="873.0"> 
declared, the Xcode build system </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="874.0" data-end="875.0"> 
will need to run to your run </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="875.0" data-end="876.0"> 
script phase on every single </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="876.0" data-end="876.0"> 
build.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="877.0" data-end="878.0"> 
So this is one of key reasons </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="878.0" data-end="880.0"> 
it's important to declare your </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="880.0" data-end="880.0"> 
inputs.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="882.0" data-end="883.0"> 
Now if any of your input files </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="883.0" data-end="885.0"> 
change, including the contents </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="885.0" data-end="887.0"> 
of your file lists or any of the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="887.0" data-end="889.0"> 
inputs that the file lists point </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="889.0" data-end="891.0"> 
to, Xcode will know that it </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="891.0" data-end="892.0"> 
needs to rerun your run script </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="892.0" data-end="893.0"> 
phase for you.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="893.0" data-end="896.0"> 
And finally, if any of your </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="896.0" data-end="898.0"> 
output files are missing, the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="898.0" data-end="899.0"> 
Xcode build system will run your </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="899.0" data-end="901.0"> 
run script phase to give you the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="901.0" data-end="903.0"> 
opportunity to generate those </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="903.0" data-end="904.0"> 
missing output files.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="905.0" data-end="908.0"> 
Now also new in Xcode 10, we </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="908.0" data-end="910.0"> 
have documentation for the run </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="910.0" data-end="911.0"> 
script phases.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="912.0" data-end="916.0"> 
</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="917.0" data-end="918.0"> 
So, it goes through more detail </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="918.0" data-end="919.0"> 
of what I just explained and it </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="919.0" data-end="920.0"> 
tells you about all of the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="920.0" data-end="921.0"> 
additional build settings that </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="921.0" data-end="922.0"> 
are made available to you, </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="923.0" data-end="924.0"> 
including how you can use those </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="924.0" data-end="926.0"> 
file lists within your own </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="926.0" data-end="926.0"> 
script content.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="928.0" data-end="929.0"> 
Now, when setting up your run </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="929.0" data-end="930.0"> 
script phases and declaring all </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="930.0" data-end="932.0"> 
of these new dependencies, and </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="932.0" data-end="934.0"> 
including when you modify the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="934.0" data-end="935.0"> 
dependencies in your targets, </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="935.0" data-end="937.0"> 
you may run into a dependency </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="937.0" data-end="937.0"> 
cycle.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="938.0" data-end="940.0"> 
And a dependency cycle is simply </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="940.0" data-end="942.0"> 
an interdependency graph </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="942.0" data-end="943.0"> 
somewhere there is a loop that's </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="943.0" data-end="943.0"> 
created.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="944.0" data-end="946.0"> 
Well, new in Xcode 10 we have </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="946.0" data-end="948.0"> 
better diagnostics to detect </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="948.0" data-end="949.0"> 
these cycles and will give you </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="949.0" data-end="951.0"> 
an error, including the ability </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="951.0" data-end="953.0"> 
for you to expand this box to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="953.0" data-end="954.0"> 
get all of the inputs that the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="954.0" data-end="956.0"> 
Xcode build system knows that </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="956.0" data-end="957.0"> 
went into creating the cycle.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="958.0" data-end="961.0"> 
So, cycles are bad for a couple </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="961.0" data-end="962.0"> 
of reasons.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="962.0" data-end="964.0"> 
One, they represent a </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="964.0" data-end="965.0"> 
configuration issue within your </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="965.0" data-end="966.0"> 
project.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="967.0" data-end="968.0"> 
And two, they can be the source </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="968.0" data-end="970.0"> 
of spurious rebuilds within your </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="970.0" data-end="970.0"> 
project.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="971.0" data-end="972.0"> 
Or of getting out-of-date </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="972.0" data-end="973.0"> 
information in your build </span></span>

process.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="975.0" data-end="977.0"> 
So we also have updated health </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="977.0" data-end="979.0"> 
topics on dependency cycles, </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="980.0" data-end="982.0"> 
including some specific sections </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="982.0" data-end="986.0"> 
that we call out of the most </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="986.0" data-end="988.0"> 
likely dependency cycles that </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="988.0" data-end="989.0"> 
you run into, and ways that you </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="989.0" data-end="990.0"> 
can fix those.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="990.0" data-end="994.0"> 
So, the last thing I want to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="994.0" data-end="995.0"> 
talk to you about today, is </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="995.0" data-end="997.0"> 
measuring your build time.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="997.0" data-end="999.0"> 
We have two new pieces of </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="999.0" data-end="1000.0"> 
functionality in Xcode 10 for </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1000.0" data-end="1000.0"> 
this.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1002.0" data-end="1005.0"> 
The first is we have introduced </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1005.0" data-end="1007.0"> 
in-line task times to give you </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1009.0" data-end="1012.0"> 
Now, I want to point out </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1012.0" data-end="1014.0"> 
something about your build logs.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1014.0" data-end="1015.0"> 
There's a filter bar across the </span></span>

top.</span></span>

And specifically, the All the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1022.0" data-end="1023.0"> 
When you have "All" selected, </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1023.0" data-end="1024.0"> 
it's going to show you all of </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1024.0" data-end="1025.0">

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1029.0" data-end="1030.0"> 
Which is usually not what you </span></span>

What you want to look at, </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1032.0" data-end="1033.0"> 
especially when you're trying to </span></span>

diagnose issues in your </span></span>

Recent tab.</span></span>

That's going to show you all of </span></span>

the build paths that went into </span></span>

the previous build operation.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1046.0" data-end="1049.0"> 
Now, another new feature in </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1049.0" data-end="1051.0"> 
Xcode 10 is a timing summary.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1051.0" data-end="1052.0"> 
And you can get to this timing </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1052.0" data-end="1054.0"> 
summary by going to the Product </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1054.0" data-end="1056.0">

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1056.0" data-end="1058.0"> 
Action, and Build with Timing </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1058.0" data-end="1058.0"> 
Summary.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1059.0" data-end="1060.0"> 
When you do that, you're going </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1060.0" data-end="1062.0"> 
to get a new log section out at </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1062.0" data-end="1063.0"> 
the end of your build log.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1063.0" data-end="1067.0"> 
And if we focus in, you're going </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1067.0" data-end="1068.0"> 
to see that it's going to give </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1068.0" data-end="1070.0"> 
you an aggregate timing of all </span></span>

last build operation.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1073.0" data-end="1074.0"> 
So this is another important </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1074.0" data-end="1076.0"> 
reason to look at the Recent </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1087.0" data-end="1088.0"> 
There was only one of them.</span></span>

It says one task.</span></span>

If you're seeing these on every </span></span>

single one of your incremental </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1095.0" data-end="1097.0">

Jordan, who's going to talk to </span></span>

you about some of the </span></span>

source-level improvements that </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1124.0" data-end="1125.0"> 
you can make to your project.</span></span>

</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1132.0" data-end="1133.0"> 
 Thanks, David.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1133.0" data-end="1134.0"> 
All right.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1134.0" data-end="1136.0"> 
So we've gone over a bunch of </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1136.0" data-end="1137.0"> 
ways where you can improve your </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1137.0" data-end="1139.0"> 
Xcode projects just by doing one </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1139.0" data-end="1140.0"> 
small change.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1141.0" data-end="1142.0"> 
And before we get to the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1142.0" data-end="1143.0"> 
source-level and file-level </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1143.0" data-end="1145.0"> 
topics, I want to talk about one </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1145.0" data-end="1147.0"> 
more that's new in Xcode 10.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1147.0" data-end="1150.0"> 
And it's a particular workaround </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1150.0" data-end="1151.0"> 
that we know that some of you </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1151.0" data-end="1153.0"> 
have been using on your projects </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1153.0" data-end="1154.0"> 
to make them build faster if </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1154.0" data-end="1155.0"> 
they have a lot of Swift files.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1157.0" data-end="1158.0"> 
You've already heard about this.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1159.0" data-end="1161.0"> 
It's the Whole Module setting </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1161.0" data-end="1162.0"> 
being used in a debug </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1162.0" data-end="1163.0"> 
configuration.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1163.0" data-end="1165.0"> 
So, in previous versions of </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1165.0" data-end="1167.0"> 
Xcode, for some projects, </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1167.0" data-end="1168.0"> 
turning on the Whole Module </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1168.0" data-end="1170.0"> 
Compilation mode, even for debug </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1170.0" data-end="1172.0"> 
builds, produced a faster </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1172.0" data-end="1174.0"> 
overall build than when used in </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1174.0" data-end="1176.0"> 
Default Incremental Modes.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1177.0" data-end="1179.0"> 
And, this did improve build </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1179.0" data-end="1180.0"> 
times because it was able to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1180.0" data-end="1182.0"> 
share -- Swift's compiler was </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1182.0" data-end="1184.0"> 
able to share work across files </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1184.0" data-end="1186.0"> 
in a way that the Incremental </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1186.0" data-end="1186.0"> 
Mode was not.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1187.0" data-end="1188.0"> 
But it also meant that you were </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1188.0" data-end="1189.0"> 
giving up your incremental </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1189.0" data-end="1191.0"> 
builds and would rebuild the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1191.0" data-end="1192.0"> 
entire target's worth of Swift </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1192.0" data-end="1194.0"> 
files every time.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1195.0" data-end="1197.0"> 
So in Xcode 10 we've improved </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1197.0" data-end="1198.0"> 
the incremental build to have </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1198.0" data-end="1200.0"> 
some of that same work sharing </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1200.0" data-end="1201.0"> 
across files.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1201.0" data-end="1202.0"> 
So you should no longer need to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1202.0" data-end="1204.0"> 
use Whole Module mode to get </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1204.0" data-end="1206.0"> 
good build times.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1208.0" data-end="1211.0"> 
</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1211.0" data-end="1213.0"> 
So, if you've done this in your </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1213.0" data-end="1214.0"> 
project, then you should go back </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1214.0" data-end="1215.0"> 
to your Build Settings Editor </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1216.0" data-end="1217.0"> 
and select the debug </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1217.0" data-end="1218.0"> 
configuration under the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1218.0" data-end="1219.0"> 
Compilation Mode build setting </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1220.0" data-end="1221.0"> 
and hit Delete.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1222.0" data-end="1223.0"> 
That will get it back to Xcode's </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1223.0" data-end="1224.0"> 
default setting of an </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1224.0" data-end="1225.0"> 
incremental build.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1225.0" data-end="1227.0"> 
I'm not going to talk much more </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1227.0" data-end="1229.0"> 
about this because you already </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1229.0" data-end="1229.0"> 
heard about it.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1230.0" data-end="1231.0"> 
We mentioned it in the "What's </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1231.0" data-end="1232.0"> 
New in Swift" talk on Tuesday.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1233.0" data-end="1235.0"> 
And if you do want to know more, </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1235.0" data-end="1236.0"> 
we'll cover this and other </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1236.0" data-end="1237.0"> 
topics about your build in </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1242.0" data-end="1246.0"> 
So we have a lot of topics that </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1246.0" data-end="1247.0"> 
we're trying to get through </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1247.0" data-end="1247.0"> 
today.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1247.0" data-end="1249.0"> 
And David's already covered half </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1249.0" data-end="1249.0"> 
of them.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1250.0" data-end="1251.0"> 
I'm going to talk about the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1251.0" data-end="1253.0"> 
remaining three dealing with </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1253.0" data-end="1254.0"> 
complex expressions at the top </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1254.0" data-end="1255.0"> 
of that list.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1256.0" data-end="1258.0"> 
And the reason for this is </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1258.0" data-end="1259.0"> 
because it's the best one that </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1259.0" data-end="1261.0"> 
exemplifies a key takeaway for </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1261.0" data-end="1263.0"> 
both of our sections.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1263.0" data-end="1265.0"> 
When a build is taking a long </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1265.0" data-end="1267.0"> 
time, there's often a key piece </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1267.0" data-end="1268.0"> 
of information that you can </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1268.0" data-end="1271.0"> 
provide to Xcode to improve the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1271.0" data-end="1271.0"> 
situation.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1273.0" data-end="1273.0"> 
And so we're going to look at </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1273.0" data-end="1276.0"> 
that first in the context of </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1276.0" data-end="1277.0"> 
complex Swift expressions.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1278.0" data-end="1281.0"> 
So here's an example of some </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1281.0" data-end="1282.0"> 
code from my latest project.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1283.0" data-end="1286.0"> 
And the problem with this struct </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1286.0" data-end="1288.0"> 
is that I use it all over the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1288.0" data-end="1289.0"> 
place.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1290.0" data-end="1291.0"> 
And it's perfectly fine to have </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1291.0" data-end="1291.0"> 
a struct.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1292.0" data-end="1293.0"> 
It's perfectly fine to have a </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1293.0" data-end="1294.0"> 
struct with a property.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1294.0" data-end="1295.0"> 
And it's fine to have a struct </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1295.0" data-end="1297.0"> 
with a property with an inferred </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1297.0" data-end="1297.0"> 
type.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1298.0" data-end="1299.0"> 
But the expression that we're </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1299.0" data-end="1301.0"> 
inferring that type from here is </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1301.0" data-end="1303.0"> 
a little bit complicated.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1303.0" data-end="1304.0"> 
It's not something simple like </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1305.0" data-end="1307.0"> 
-- Oh, I took out a build from </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1307.0" data-end="1307.0"> 
my slides.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1308.0" data-end="1310.0"> 
So I've given away the answer </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1310.0" data-end="1310.0"> 
here.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1310.0" data-end="1313.0"> 
If this were something like 0.0, </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1313.0" data-end="1315.0"> 
then this inference of double </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1315.0" data-end="1316.0"> 
here wouldn't really have been </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1316.0" data-end="1317.0"> 
necessary.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1318.0" data-end="1319.0"> 
But since we've got this big, </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1319.0" data-end="1321.0"> 
complicated expression involving </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1321.0" data-end="1323.0"> 
reduced and the power function </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1323.0" data-end="1326.0"> 
from the system frameworks, you </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1326.0" data-end="1328.0"> 
might not have even guessed that </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1328.0" data-end="1329.0"> 
"double" was inferred type of </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1329.0" data-end="1330.0"> 
this property.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1331.0" data-end="1332.0"> 
And so by providing this </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1332.0" data-end="1334.0"> 
information here, you've saved </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1334.0" data-end="1335.0"> 
work that the compiler would </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1335.0" data-end="1337.0"> 
have to do in every file that </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1337.0" data-end="1338.0"> 
uses this struct.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1339.0" data-end="1341.0"> 
And you've also saved work that </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1341.0" data-end="1343.0"> 
your coworkers would have to do </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1343.0" data-end="1345.0"> 
to figure out what really is the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1345.0" data-end="1346.0"> 
type of that big number </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1346.0" data-end="1346.0"> 
property.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1347.0" data-end="1350.0"> 
So a lot of times you can get </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1350.0" data-end="1351.0"> 
this extra key piece of </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1351.0" data-end="1352.0"> 
information that will help your </span></span>

build times is also an example </span></span>

of a good software engineering </span></span>

practice.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1357.0" data-end="1358.0"> 
Let's take a look at another </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1358.0" data-end="1360.0"> 
example involving closures.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1361.0" data-end="1363.0"> 
This time I'm trying to define a </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1363.0" data-end="1364.0"> 
function that will return the </span></span>

sum of the non-optional values </span></span>

of its arguments.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1368.0" data-end="1370.0"> 
And if all three arguments are </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1370.0" data-end="1371.0"> 
nil, it will return nil.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1373.0" data-end="1374.0"> 
And I'm trying to use one of </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1374.0" data-end="1376.0"> 
Swift's cool features where if </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1376.0" data-end="1378.0">

expression to help determine the </span></span>

type of the closure.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1385.0" data-end="1386.0"> 
Sometimes this is really </span></span>

convenient.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1388.0" data-end="1390.0"> 
Other times it can lead to code </span></span>

We've got some nested turnery </span></span>

I don't really think this is </span></span>

too.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1409.0" data-end="1411.0"> 
Because this expression is </span></span>

something about this code.</span></span>

So, my first option here would </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1430.0" data-end="1432.0"> 
be to do the same thing as the </span></span>

previous example and provide </span></span>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1435.0" data-end="1436.0"> 
With a closure, you can do that </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1436.0" data-end="1437.0"> 
just before the In Key word.</span></span>

But, this may not be the best </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1441.0" data-end="1442.0"> 
solution for this particular </span></span>

problem.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1443.0" data-end="1444.0"> 
So let's go back to what we had </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1444.0" data-end="1445.0"> 
before.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1446.0" data-end="1448.0"> 
Recall that I said that I'm </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1448.0" data-end="1449.0">

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1451.0" data-end="1453.0"> 
be used to help determine the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1453.0" data-end="1453.0"> 
type of the closure.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1455.0" data-end="1456.0"> 
But in this case, that's not </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1456.0" data-end="1457.0"> 
really necessary.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1458.0" data-end="1460.0"> 
We already know from the call to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1460.0" data-end="1462.0"> 
Reduce what this closure has to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1462.0" data-end="1462.0"> 
be.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1463.0" data-end="1464.0"> 
Reduce is being called on an </span></span>

And the result type has to match </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1468.0" data-end="1470.0"> 
the return type of the function.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1471.0" data-end="1473.0"> 
So we already know that this </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1473.0" data-end="1475.0">

integers.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1478.0" data-end="1480.0"> 
That means there's no need to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1480.0" data-end="1481.0"> 
put a single expression in that </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1481.0" data-end="1482.0"> 
closure.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1482.0" data-end="1484.0"> 
And it's perfectly okay to break </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1484.0" data-end="1486.0"> 
it up into separate, more </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1486.0" data-end="1487.0"> 
readable statements.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1488.0" data-end="1489.0"> 
So here's a direct translation </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1489.0" data-end="1491.0"> 
of the code that I had before.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1492.0" data-end="1493.0"> 
But I also have the freedom now </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1494.0" data-end="1495.0"> 
to make it something more </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1495.0" data-end="1495.0"> 
Swifty.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1496.0" data-end="1497.0"> 
This is a lot more readable.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1498.0" data-end="1499.0"> 
A lot more maintainable.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1499.0" data-end="1501.0"> 
And it compiles in a quick, </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1501.0" data-end="1502.0"> 
reasonable amount of time.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1503.0" data-end="1506.0"> 
Now, the last example I'm going </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1506.0" data-end="1507.0"> 
to show in this section is </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1507.0" data-end="1509.0"> 
something that won't apply quite </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1509.0" data-end="1510.0"> 
as broadly as the previous two.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1511.0" data-end="1513.0"> 
It's about this type Any Object.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1514.0" data-end="1517.0"> 
Now, Any Object is a convenient </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1517.0" data-end="1520.0"> 
type that describes any class </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1520.0" data-end="1520.0"> 
instance.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1520.0" data-end="1522.0"> 
So not a struct or an enum.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1522.0" data-end="1523.0"> 
Definitely a class.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1523.0" data-end="1524.0"> 
But we don't know which one.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1525.0" data-end="1527.0"> 
But it also has an additional </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1527.0" data-end="1528.0"> 
feature carried over from </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1528.0" data-end="1530.0"> 
Objective-C's ID type.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1531.0" data-end="1533.0"> 
And that's this method call </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1533.0" data-end="1533.0"> 
syntax.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1534.0" data-end="1536.0"> 
If you try to call a method or </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1536.0" data-end="1538.0"> 
access a property on a value of </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1538.0" data-end="1540.0"> 
type Any Object, Swift will </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1540.0" data-end="1542.0"> 
allow you to do so, as long as </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1542.0" data-end="1545.0"> 
that method is visible somewhere </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1545.0" data-end="1547.0"> 
in your project and exposed to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1547.0" data-end="1548.0"> 
the Objective-C runtime.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1549.0" data-end="1550.0"> 
However, this does come at a </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1550.0" data-end="1551.0"> 
cost.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1552.0" data-end="1553.0"> 
Because the compiler doesn't </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1553.0" data-end="1555.0"> 
know which method you're going </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1555.0" data-end="1557.0"> 
to call, it has to go search out </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1557.0" data-end="1559.0"> 
any possible implementations </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1559.0" data-end="1560.0"> 
throughout your project and the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1560.0" data-end="1563.0"> 
frameworks you import and assume </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1563.0" data-end="1564.0"> 
that they might be the one </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1564.0" data-end="1565.0"> 
that's going to be used.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1566.0" data-end="1568.0"> 
It has to do this because if </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1568.0" data-end="1569.0"> 
none of them match, it needs to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1569.0" data-end="1570.0"> 
present you with an error.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1572.0" data-end="1574.0"> 
So instead, we can do something </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1574.0" data-end="1576.0"> 
much better and much more, </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1576.0" data-end="1578.0"> 
again, declarative of our </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1578.0" data-end="1579.0"> 
intent.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1579.0" data-end="1581.0"> 
We can define a protocol.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1581.0" data-end="1582.0"> 
Now, this can be done in the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1582.0" data-end="1584.0"> 
same file, or a different file, </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1585.0" data-end="1587.0"> 
but the important part is that </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1587.0" data-end="1588.0"> 
once we change this delegate </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1588.0" data-end="1590.0"> 
property to use our protocol </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1590.0" data-end="1592.0"> 
instead of Any Object, the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1592.0" data-end="1594.0"> 
compiler knows exactly which </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1594.0" data-end="1595.0"> 
method it's calling.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1597.0" data-end="1598.0"> 
And now you also have the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1598.0" data-end="1599.0"> 
opportunity for all of your </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1599.0" data-end="1601.0"> 
implementing types to be checked </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1602.0" data-end="1603.0"> 
that they implement the method </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1603.0" data-end="1603.0"> 
correctly.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1606.0" data-end="1608.0"> 
So, we've talked about several </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1608.0" data-end="1610.0"> 
techniques here for decreasing </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1610.0" data-end="1611.0"> 
the amount of work the compiler </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1611.0" data-end="1613.0"> 
does once it's already decided </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1613.0" data-end="1615.0"> 
to recompile a file.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1616.0" data-end="1618.0"> 
But what about not recompiling </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1618.0" data-end="1619.0"> 
the file at all? </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1619.0" data-end="1621.0"> 
What makes the compiler choose </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1621.0" data-end="1623.0"> 
whether a file needs to be </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1623.0" data-end="1623.0"> 
recompiled? </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1624.0" data-end="1626.0"> 
For that, we need to understand </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1626.0" data-end="1627.0"> 
Swift's dependency model.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1629.0" data-end="1632.0"> 
Now, Swift's dependency model is </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1632.0" data-end="1633.0"> 
based around files.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1634.0" data-end="1635.0"> 
And it's a little bit tricky </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1635.0" data-end="1637.0"> 
because in Swift there are no </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1637.0" data-end="1637.0"> 
header files.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1638.0" data-end="1640.0"> 
We just see everything that's </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1640.0" data-end="1642.0"> 
defined somewhere in our target </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1642.0" data-end="1643.0"> 
by default.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1644.0" data-end="1645.0"> 
In this case, I'm declaring a </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1645.0" data-end="1646.0"> 
struct point in the file on the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1646.0" data-end="1647.0"> 
left.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1647.0" data-end="1649.0"> 
And if I bring in a file on the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1649.0" data-end="1651.0"> 
right, the compiler knows that </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1651.0" data-end="1652.0"> 
I'm referring to that first </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1652.0" data-end="1653.0"> 
declaration.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1654.0" data-end="1655.0"> 
The same is true for the use of </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1655.0" data-end="1657.0"> 
the X and Y properties in that </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1657.0" data-end="1661.0"> 
file on the right.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1661.0" data-end="1663.0"> 
Now, this file-based dependency </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1663.0" data-end="1664.0"> 
means that if I change the file </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1664.0" data-end="1667.0"> 
on the left, both files will </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1667.0" data-end="1669.0"> 
need to be recompiled.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1670.0" data-end="1671.0"> 
And that's important because </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1671.0" data-end="1672.0"> 
we're actually trying to call </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1672.0" data-end="1673.0"> 
this initializer.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1674.0" data-end="1675.0"> 
And we want to make sure that </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1675.0" data-end="1676.0"> 
we're calling it correctly.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1677.0" data-end="1680.0"> 
The compiler is smart enough to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1680.0" data-end="1681.0"> 
know that when you make change </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1681.0" data-end="1684.0"> 
within a function body, in this </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1684.0" data-end="1685.0"> 
case making the assertion more </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1685.0" data-end="1689.0"> 
appropriate, that only that file </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1689.0" data-end="1690.0"> 
will need to be recompiled.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1691.0" data-end="1693.0"> 
Other files won't have to change </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1693.0" data-end="1695.0"> 
how they use the API's from the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1695.0" data-end="1696.0"> 
first file.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1696.0" data-end="1700.0"> 
However, it does need to be </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1700.0" data-end="1700.0"> 
conservative.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1701.0" data-end="1702.0"> 
And so if I add a separate type </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1702.0" data-end="1705.0"> 
to this file, a human can tell </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1705.0" data-end="1706.0"> 
that this path segment struct </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1706.0" data-end="1708.0"> 
won't affect the file on the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1708.0" data-end="1708.0"> 
right.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1709.0" data-end="1710.0"> 
But the compiler will still be </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1710.0" data-end="1711.0"> 
conservative and rebuild them </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1711.0" data-end="1712.0"> 
both.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1712.0" data-end="1716.0"> 
Let's see how this applies to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1716.0" data-end="1717.0"> 
the game example that David was </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1717.0" data-end="1718.0"> 
using earlier.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1719.0" data-end="1720.0"> 
So here we have the app target </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1720.0" data-end="1721.0"> 
and the Utilities framework.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1721.0" data-end="1722.0"> 
And I'm showing some of the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1722.0" data-end="1724.0"> 
Swift files that are in each </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1724.0" data-end="1724.0"> 
target.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1725.0" data-end="1727.0"> 
So if I change a file in the App </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1727.0" data-end="1730.0"> 
target, well, we know already </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1730.0" data-end="1731.0"> 
that that file needs to be </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1731.0" data-end="1732.0"> 
recompiled.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1732.0" data-end="1733.0"> 
And of course, anything that </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1733.0" data-end="1735.0"> 
depends on that file will also </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1735.0" data-end="1736.0"> 
need to be recompiled.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1737.0" data-end="1738.0"> 
But there's no chance that </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1738.0" data-end="1739.0"> 
anything within the utilities </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1739.0" data-end="1741.0"> 
target will be recompiled.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1742.0" data-end="1743.0"> 
It's in a separate target.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1743.0" data-end="1745.0"> 
It has an explicit dependency.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1745.0" data-end="1747.0"> 
And it doesn't have implicit </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1747.0" data-end="1749.0"> 
visibility between those two </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1749.0" data-end="1752.0"> 
sets of files.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1752.0" data-end="1755.0"> 
Now, similarly, if I change </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1755.0" data-end="1756.0"> 
something in the framework </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1756.0" data-end="1757.0"> 
target, then I would need to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1757.0" data-end="1760.0"> 
recompile that file and anything </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1760.0" data-end="1761.0"> 
else in the utilities framework </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1761.0" data-end="1762.0"> 
that depends on it.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1763.0" data-end="1764.0"> 
However, these dependencies are </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1764.0" data-end="1765.0"> 
more coarse-grained.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1766.0" data-end="1768.0"> 
And so Xcode will also recompile </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1768.0" data-end="1769.0"> 
everything that's in the Game </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1769.0" data-end="1772.0"> 
target as well, unless the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1772.0" data-end="1774.0"> 
changes are entirely confined to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1774.0" data-end="1774.0"> 
function bodies.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1775.0" data-end="1778.0"> 
So to recap those rules, the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1778.0" data-end="1779.0"> 
compiler needs to be </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1779.0" data-end="1780.0"> 
conservative.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1781.0" data-end="1782.0"> 
Even if a human can tell that a </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1782.0" data-end="1783.0"> 
change doesn't affect other </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1783.0" data-end="1785.0"> 
files, that doesn't necessarily </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1785.0" data-end="1786.0"> 
mean that the compiler can.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1787.0" data-end="1789.0"> 
However, one change that the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1789.0" data-end="1791.0"> 
compiler does know how to handle </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1791.0" data-end="1792.0"> 
is function bodies.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1792.0" data-end="1794.0"> 
It knows that this doesn't </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1794.0" data-end="1795.0"> 
affect the file's interface.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1795.0" data-end="1797.0"> 
And therefore, will not require </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1797.0" data-end="1799.0"> 
other files to be recompiled.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1802.0" data-end="1804.0"> 
This per-file dependency basis </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1804.0" data-end="1806.0"> 
happens within a module, which </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1806.0" data-end="1808.0"> 
is where Swift declarations are </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1808.0" data-end="1809.0"> 
implicitly visible to one </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1809.0" data-end="1810.0"> 
another.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1810.0" data-end="1811.0"> 
When you're dealing with </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1811.0" data-end="1813.0"> 
cross-module dependencies via </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1813.0" data-end="1815.0"> 
your imports or your bridging </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1815.0" data-end="1816.0"> 
header, these are dependencies </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1816.0" data-end="1817.0"> 
on the entire target.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1818.0" data-end="1821.0"> 
So this is all good information </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1821.0" data-end="1824.0"> 
about Swift dependencies, and </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1824.0" data-end="1825.0"> 
Swift targets.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1825.0" data-end="1827.0"> 
But I know a lot of you out here </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1827.0" data-end="1829.0"> 
have mixed Objective-C and Swift </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1829.0" data-end="1829.0"> 
targets.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1829.0" data-end="1831.0"> 
And so the last section is going </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1831.0" data-end="1833.0"> 
to be focused on that, on how to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1833.0" data-end="1834.0"> 
reduce the interface between the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1834.0" data-end="1836.0"> 
Swift and the Objective-C code </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1836.0" data-end="1837.0"> 
in a mixed-source app.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1838.0" data-end="1840.0"> 
And to do this, we're going to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1840.0" data-end="1842.0"> 
have to talk about the parts of </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1842.0" data-end="1842.0"> 
a mixed-source app.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1844.0" data-end="1844.0"> 
And this diagram's going to get </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1844.0" data-end="1846.0"> 
a little complicated, so bear </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1846.0" data-end="1846.0"> 
with me.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1846.0" data-end="1848.0"> 
And if you're watching on video, </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1848.0" data-end="1849.0"> 
you may need to pause and </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1849.0" data-end="1849.0"> 
restart.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1850.0" data-end="1851.0"> 
Feel free.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1852.0" data-end="1854.0"> 
We start off with the headers </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1854.0" data-end="1856.0"> 
that describe your Objective-C </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1856.0" data-end="1856.0"> 
interface.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1857.0" data-end="1858.0"> 
This is the parts of your app </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1858.0" data-end="1860.0"> 
that are written in Objective-C </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1860.0" data-end="1861.0"> 
that you may want to expose to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1861.0" data-end="1861.0"> 
Swift.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1862.0" data-end="1863.0"> 
Or perhaps you're just declaring </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1863.0" data-end="1865.0"> 
headers for other Objective-C </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1865.0" data-end="1867.0"> 
parts of your app.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1868.0" data-end="1869.0"> 
Then we have the bridging </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1869.0" data-end="1869.0"> 
header.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1870.0" data-end="1871.0"> 
This is the header that collects </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1871.0" data-end="1873.0"> 
all of the information that you </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1873.0" data-end="1875.0"> 
want to expose to the Swift part </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1875.0" data-end="1876.0"> 
of your app.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1877.0" data-end="1879.0"> 
This is a build setting in Xcode </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1879.0" data-end="1881.0"> 
that controls which header is </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1881.0" data-end="1881.0"> 
used.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1881.0" data-end="1883.0"> 
And once it's set, the Swift </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1883.0" data-end="1885.0"> 
compiler will know to expose </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1885.0" data-end="1887.0"> 
those Objective-C interfaces to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1887.0" data-end="1888.0"> 
your Swift code.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1890.0" data-end="1892.0"> 
The Swift compiler will then </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1892.0" data-end="1894.0"> 
produce a generated header, </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1895.0" data-end="1896.0"> 
which does the same thing in </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1896.0" data-end="1896.0"> 
reverse.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1897.0" data-end="1899.0"> 
It describes which parts of your </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1899.0" data-end="1901.0"> 
Swift code will be exposed to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1901.0" data-end="1902.0"> 
Objective-C.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1903.0" data-end="1905.0"> 
That can then be used in your </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1905.0" data-end="1907.0"> 
Objective-C implementation </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1907.0" data-end="1909.0"> 
files, which probably also use </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1909.0" data-end="1910.0"> 
some of those headers from the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1910.0" data-end="1911.0"> 
first step.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1911.0" data-end="1913.0"> 
And then of course, you might </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1913.0" data-end="1915.0"> 
have Objective-C code that is </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1915.0" data-end="1917.0"> 
not dependent on any of the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1917.0" data-end="1918.0"> 
Swift code.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1918.0" data-end="1920.0"> 
But that's less interesting for </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1920.0" data-end="1921.0"> 
this part of the talk.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1922.0" data-end="1923.0"> 
So, I'll step through that from </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1923.0" data-end="1924.0"> 
left to right again.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1925.0" data-end="1927.0"> 
We have the Objective-C headers.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1928.0" data-end="1930.0"> 
The bridging header for getting </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1930.0" data-end="1931.0"> 
some of that information into </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1931.0" data-end="1932.0"> 
Swift.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1933.0" data-end="1934.0"> 
Your Swift implementation files.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1935.0" data-end="1937.0"> 
A generated header for </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1937.0" data-end="1939.0"> 
presenting that information back </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1939.0" data-end="1940.0"> 
to Objective-C.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1940.0" data-end="1941.0"> 
And then finally, your </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1941.0" data-end="1943.0"> 
Objective-C implementation </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1943.0" data-end="1944.0"> 
files.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1944.0" data-end="1948.0"> 
And in a diagram like this, all </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1948.0" data-end="1950.0"> 
of these arrows represent </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1950.0" data-end="1951.0"> 
dependencies.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1951.0" data-end="1952.0"> 
Not dependencies on a target </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1952.0" data-end="1954.0"> 
level, but within on a </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1955.0" data-end="1956.0"> 
file-by-file level within a </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1956.0" data-end="1957.0"> 
target.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1958.0" data-end="1960.0"> 
And so, what we want to do is </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1960.0" data-end="1961.0"> 
focus on the generated header </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1961.0" data-end="1963.0"> 
and the bridging header, because </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1963.0" data-end="1964.0"> 
if we can shrink the content in </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1964.0" data-end="1966.0"> 
these headers, then we know that </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1966.0" data-end="1968.0"> 
there's fewer chances for things </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1968.0" data-end="1969.0"> 
to change.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1969.0" data-end="1971.0"> 
And therefore, less need to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1971.0" data-end="1971.0"> 
rebuild.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1972.0" data-end="1974.0"> 
So let's take a look.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1974.0" data-end="1976.0"> 
For the generated header, your </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1976.0" data-end="1977.0"> 
strongest tool is going to be </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1977.0" data-end="1978.0"> 
the private key word.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1979.0" data-end="1981.0"> 
So in this example, I have a </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1981.0" data-end="1982.0"> 
view controller that I'm </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1982.0" data-end="1983.0"> 
defining in Swift.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1983.0" data-end="1984.0"> 
And it has an it an IBOutlet </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1984.0" data-end="1986.0"> 
property and an IBAction method.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1987.0" data-end="1989.0"> 
By default, these will be </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1989.0" data-end="1991.0"> 
exposed in your generated header </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1992.0" data-end="1994.0"> 
because they're methods and </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1994.0" data-end="1995.0"> 
properties exposed to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1995.0" data-end="1996.0"> 
Objective-C.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1997.0" data-end="1998.0"> 
And they're not declared as </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1998.0" data-end="1998.0"> 
private.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2000.0" data-end="2002.0"> 
But most of the time you don't </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2002.0" data-end="2003.0"> 
need to expose these to any </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2003.0" data-end="2004.0"> 
other files in your project.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2005.0" data-end="2006.0"> 
They're just for interacting </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2006.0" data-end="2007.0"> 
with Interface Builder.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2008.0" data-end="2010.0"> 
And so, in this case, I can mark </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2010.0" data-end="2012.0"> 
these private and watch as the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2012.0" data-end="2014.0"> 
property and method vanish from </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2014.0" data-end="2015.0"> 
the generated header.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2017.0" data-end="2019.0"> 
Another example of this is when </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2019.0" data-end="2021.0"> 
dealing with methods exposed to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2021.0" data-end="2023.0"> 
Objective-C for use with </span></span>

Objective-C runtime features </span></span>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2026.0" data-end="2027.0"> 
In this case, I'm using </span></span>

foundations Notification Center </span></span>

Once again, the only requirement </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2038.0" data-end="2039.0"> 
here is that the method is </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2039.0" data-end="2040.0"> 
exposed to Objective-C.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2040.0" data-end="2042.0"> 
It doesn't actually need to be </span></span>

project, Swift or Objective-C.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2046.0" data-end="2049.0"> 
So I can mark it private.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2050.0" data-end="2051.0"> 
And once again have that </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2051.0" data-end="2053.0"> 
reduction in the shape of my </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2054.0" data-end="2057.0"> 
In cases like this, there's </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2057.0" data-end="2059.0"> 
often another option as well.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2059.0" data-end="2060.0"> 
And that's to switch to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2060.0" data-end="2061.0"> 
block-based API's.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2062.0" data-end="2064.0"> 
In many cases, this can even </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2064.0" data-end="2065.0"> 
clear up your code because you </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2065.0" data-end="2067.0"> 
can implicitly capture state </span></span>

registering for the notification </span></span>

along as some kind of context </span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2074.0" data-end="2077.0"> 
Now, the last tip for reducing </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2077.0" data-end="2078.0"> 
the contents of your generated </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2078.0" data-end="2081.0"> 
header is actually a very old </span></span>

one.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2081.0" data-end="2083.0"> 
You can migrate to Swift 4.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2084.0" data-end="2085.0"> 
And you've already heard that </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2085.0" data-end="2086.0"> 
you're going to have to do that </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2086.0" data-end="2087.0"> 
this year.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2087.0" data-end="2089.0"> 
That Xcode 10 will be the last </span></span>

set of releases where Swift 3 </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2091.0" data-end="2092.0"> 
mode is supported.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2093.0" data-end="2096.0"> 
And so, this is something you'll </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2096.0" data-end="2097.0"> 
be doing anyway.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2097.0" data-end="2099.0"> 
Edit. Convert.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2099.0" data-end="2101.0"> 
To Current Swift Syntax.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2102.0" data-end="2104.0"> 
However, when you do this </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2104.0" data-end="2106.0"> 
migration, you may have actually </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2106.0" data-end="2109.0"> 
selected to keep the Swift 3 </span></span>

And that's the Swift 3 @objc </span></span>

imprints.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2116.0" data-end="2117.0"> 
This is an option when you </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2117.0" data-end="2119.0"> 
migrate to Swift 4 to keep on a </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2119.0" data-end="2122.0">

any subclass of NS Object.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2130.0" data-end="2131.0"> 
Now, if you are writing in Swift </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2131.0" data-end="2133.0">

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2133.0" data-end="2133.0"> 
feature.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2134.0" data-end="2135.0"> 
But there's a lot of cases where </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2136.0" data-end="2137.0"> 
you were not actually depending </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2137.0" data-end="2138.0"> 
on this in any way.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2139.0" data-end="2140.0"> 
Not in the runtime sense.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2140.0" data-end="2142.0"> 
And definitely not at compile </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2142.0" data-end="2142.0"> 
time.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2143.0" data-end="2145.0"> 
So, once you get to the point </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2145.0" data-end="2147.0"> 
where you've explicitly marked </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2147.0" data-end="2148.0"> 
all of your Objective-C </span></span>

IBOutlet, IBAction, whatever, as </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2154.0" data-end="2156.0"> 
appropriate, then you can also </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2156.0" data-end="2157.0"> 
select this build setting and </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2157.0" data-end="2159.0"> 
hit Delete to get it back to the </span></span>

default mode where the OB-C </span></span>

for methods and properties that </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2165.0" data-end="2168.0"> 
satisfy protocol requirements or </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2168.0" data-end="2169.0"> 
those that override methods that </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2169.0" data-end="2170.0"> 
come from Objective-C.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2171.0" data-end="2174.0"> 
So we've talked a lot about the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2174.0" data-end="2175.0"> 
generated header and what you </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2175.0" data-end="2177.0"> 
can do to your Swift code.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2177.0" data-end="2179.0"> 
But you have Objective-C code as </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2179.0" data-end="2179.0"> 
well.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2180.0" data-end="2181.0"> 
And the Objective-C code, </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2181.0" data-end="2183.0"> 
likewise, causes rebuilds.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2184.0" data-end="2185.0"> 
And so a bridging header looks </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2185.0" data-end="2187.0"> 
something like this, usually.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2187.0" data-end="2188.0"> 
It's got a bunch of other </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2188.0" data-end="2189.0"> 
headers in the project that </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2189.0" data-end="2190.0"> 
you're trying to expose to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2190.0" data-end="2191.0"> 
Swift.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2192.0" data-end="2194.0"> 
And we can zoom in on one of </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2194.0" data-end="2194.0"> 
these headers here, the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2194.0" data-end="2197.0"> 
MyViewController header and see </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2197.0" data-end="2198.0"> 
that it's a perfectly normal </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2198.0" data-end="2199.0"> 
declaration of a view </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2199.0" data-end="2200.0"> 
controller.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2200.0" data-end="2202.0"> 
But also that it itself includes </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2202.0" data-end="2203.0"> 
another header.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2204.0" data-end="2206.0"> 
What that means is that if any </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2206.0" data-end="2208.0"> 
of these headers change, the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2208.0" data-end="2209.0"> 
Swift code in your target has to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2209.0" data-end="2211.0"> 
be recompiled because it might </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2211.0" data-end="2212.0"> 
depend on something that </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2212.0" data-end="2213.0"> 
changed.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2214.0" data-end="2216.0"> 
This is suboptimal.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2216.0" data-end="2219.0"> 
And now we can notice that in </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2219.0" data-end="2221.0"> 
this example, the only reason </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2221.0" data-end="2223.0"> 
we're importing the MyNetwork </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2223.0" data-end="2224.0"> 
Manager header is to declare </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2224.0" data-end="2226.0"> 
this property, this network </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2226.0" data-end="2227.0"> 
manager property on the view </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2227.0" data-end="2228.0"> 
controller.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2229.0" data-end="2231.0"> 
And it's possible that that </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2231.0" data-end="2234.0"> 
property is never actually used </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2234.0" data-end="2234.0"> 
from Swift.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2235.0" data-end="2237.0"> 
In which case, it's unnecessary </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2237.0" data-end="2239.0"> 
for us to be declaring it here.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2240.0" data-end="2241.0"> 
So what you can do is use </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2241.0" data-end="2243.0"> 
categories, Objective-C's </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2243.0" data-end="2245.0"> 
equivalent of extensions, to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2245.0" data-end="2246.0"> 
break up this interface.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2247.0" data-end="2248.0"> 
So I'm going to define a new </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2248.0" data-end="2250.0"> 
file here, MyViewController </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2250.0" data-end="2252.0"> 
Internal, and use the special </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2252.0" data-end="2254.0"> 
nameless category syntax that </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2254.0" data-end="2256.0"> 
allows me to declare additional </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2256.0" data-end="2257.0"> 
properties while still taking </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2257.0" data-end="2259.0"> 
advantage of the property </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2259.0" data-end="2261.0"> 
synthesis feature in my main Add </span></span>

Implementation block.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2262.0" data-end="2267.0"> 
Now I can just move the import </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2267.0" data-end="2268.0"> 
and the property down to the </span></span>

category.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2269.0" data-end="2270.0"> 
And voila! </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2270.0" data-end="2272.0"> 
The headers that are being </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2272.0" data-end="2274.0"> 
imported into Swift have gotten </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2274.0" data-end="2276.0"> 
much smaller and are much less </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2276.0" data-end="2278.0"> 
likely to change now and cause </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2278.0" data-end="2279.0"> 
an unnecessary rebuild.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2280.0" data-end="2281.0"> 
And there's one more note.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2282.0" data-end="2284.0"> 
This file here that I defined, </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2284.0" data-end="2286.0"> 
well, it's possible that nothing </span></span>

else in my Objective-C code </span></span>

either.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2291.0" data-end="2292.0"> 
In which case, there's no need </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2292.0" data-end="2293.0"> 
for a separate file.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2294.0" data-end="2296.0"> 
I can put this category directly </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2296.0" data-end="2297.0"> 
into my .m.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2298.0" data-end="2299.0">

this.</span></span>

Everything will work fine.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2301.0" data-end="2303.0"> 
And as I said before, property </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2303.0" data-end="2304.0"> 
synthesis will still work for </span></span>

the network manager property.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2306.0" data-end="2308.0"> 
So what have we seen? </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2309.0" data-end="2312.0"> 
We used private and block-based </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2312.0" data-end="2314.0">

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2318.0" data-end="2320.0"> 
And, we've broken out separate </span></span>

contents from the Objective-C </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2322.0" data-end="2324.0">

shrink the contents of the </span></span>

opportunities for changes, which </span></span>

rebuilds.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2336.0" data-end="2337.0"> 
We win on both counts.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2339.0" data-end="2341.0"> 
So let's wrap things up.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2342.0" data-end="2344.0"> 
David and I talked a lot about </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2344.0" data-end="2346.0"> 
quite a few different topics, of </span></span>

ways that you can get more </span></span>

you can provide more information </span></span>
