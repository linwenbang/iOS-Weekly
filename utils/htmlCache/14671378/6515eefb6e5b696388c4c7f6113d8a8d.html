        <p>Hello, Swift Community.</p>
<p>The review for the revisions to <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0235-add-result.md" rel="nofollow noopener">SE-0235: Add <code>Result</code> to the Standard Library</a> ran from November 28th through December 2nd.  You can find the review thread <a href="https://forums.swift.org/t/revised-se-0235-add-result-to-the-standard-library/18371">here</a>.  There was also <a href="https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0235-add-result-to-the-standard-library/17752">an earlier round of review</a> for the initial proposal.</p>
<p>The community provided a lot of very good feedback on the proposed revisions.  Almost all of it was strongly positive about the revised proposal overall, but many community members expressed reservations about various aspects of it.  The Core Team discussed this feedback today and reached several conclusions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>While several members of the community supported naming the cases <code>value</code> and <code>error</code>, overall people seemed to prefer the original proposal's case names: <code>success</code> and <code>failure</code>.  After considering this feedback, the Core Team has come to agree that these are excellent "semantic" names which work better than <code>value</code> and <code>error</code> as labels for the current state of a <code>Result</code> value.  They read more fluently when constructing a <code>Result</code> or pattern-matching on it, especially when the value type is <code>()</code>, and they avoid confusion over the fact that a <code>Result</code> is itself a value.</p>
<p>The concern that originally led the Core Team to suggest renaming the cases was about the cognitive load of using different names for the cases, case accessors, and type parameters of the same type.  It's easy to remember these differences when reading the proposal, but this will predictably become an annoyance after a few months.  But this doesn't specifically require using <code>value</code> and <code>error</code>; any consistent set of names will do.  So we should consider whether we could use <code>success</code> and <code>failure</code> for the type parameters and case accessors.</p>
<p><code>Success</code> and <code>Failure</code> are reasonable choices for the type parameter names.  <code>Failure</code> is particularly nice because it's a problem to have both an <code>Error</code> parameter and a global <code>Swift.Error</code> type: not because the shadowing is difficult for the compiler, but because the reuse of the name makes code harder to read and — perhaps more importantly — makes it unnecessarily awkward to talk about in person.  These names are also rarely used in code, as they only ever need to be written within extensions of <code>Result</code>.</p>
<p>Case accessors are a more complex question.  The current proposal doesn't include case accessors, but the original proposal did, and we're anticipating a future proposal that will add automatic synthesis for case accessors.  That synthesis will undoubtedly use names based on the actual case names, so at a first glance, it seems imprudent to use case names that we're not sure we'd want for the accessors.  However, feedback on this review has led the Core Team to more seriously consider this issue, and it now seems quite complicated.  A name that's a good name for a particular state of an <code>enum</code> (like <code>failure</code>) might not be a good name for a value carried in that case (like <code>error</code>).  It may be true that case accessor names will always end up feeling a little contrived, and so it's just better to use the actual case names because they're easy to interpret.  More importantly, we don't want to burden this proposal because we haven't resolved those questions yet to our satisfaction.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the case names are revised (back) to <code>success</code> and <code>failure</code>, and the type parameter names are revised to <code>Success</code> and <code>Failure</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many people in the community strongly supported requiring <code>Failure</code> to conform to <code>Error</code>, although this was not universal.  The Core Team remains convinced that this is the right thing to do.  We do not see any need to add new conformances to <code>Error</code> for library types like <code>Array</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Several members of the community voiced disappointment that the proposal did not include a variant of <code>flatMap</code> that took a throwing closure.  The Core Team reaffirms its desire to never overload methods by whether an argument function can throw.  We spent quite some time debating whether a different name would be acceptable, such as <code>flatMapThrowing</code>, but were unable to reach consensus on this, especially as there are alternative means of expressing this using the catching initializer.</p>
<p>Several members of the Core Team expressed discomfort with the use of the name <code>flatMap</code> on non-collection types.  Since it would be unreasonable for the Core Team to introduce a novel name without review, and since there is already precedent for this name from <code>Optional.flatMap</code>, and since this is quite an important operation on <code>Result</code>, there was consensus to accept it under the name <code>flatMap</code> regardless of that discomfort.  However, we would like to invite further discussion about the name of this operation on <code>Optional</code> and <code>Result</code>.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the map functions remain as stated in the revision.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Several members of the community expressed dislike of the name <code>unwrapped()</code>, as it seems insufficiently "active" for an operation that is essentially designed to throw as a core part of its operation.  The Core Team agrees and also feels that <code>unwrapped</code> is awkward because nothing else about <code>Result</code> uses "wrapping" as an analogy.  Furthermore, a similar operation will be needed on other computation-related types like <code>Future</code>, and it would be good for these to share a consistent name.  The Core Team debated this and ultimately settled on <code>get()</code>.  That this operation can throw should be apparent enough from the mandatory use of <code>try</code> before the call.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Core Team acknowledges the call from several reviewers to make a special effort to communicate how we think <code>Result</code> ought to be used in Swift.  We absolutely agree that is an important part of adding <code>Result</code> to the language, and we intend to provide this guidance as part of the release.</p>
<p>Although we are revising the proposal again, the Core Team feels that these issues have already received adequate review, and there is no need for a third round of review.  Accordingly, SE-0235 has been <strong>Accepted with Modifications</strong>.</p>
<p>Please remember that there will be opportunities to extend this type in the future.</p>
<p>As always, thank you for helping to make Swift a better language.</p>

        <p>I'm disappointed to see the reversion on the case names and especially sad to see <code>Success</code> and <code>Failure</code> chosen as the parameter names.  These feel like rather awkward names for the type parameters to me where <code>Value</code> and <code>Error</code> are very straightforward.  I don't think I will ever get used to or fully comfortable with these names.  Nevertheless, I am happy to see that we will finally have a <code>Result</code> type in the standard library!</p>

        <p>I brought this up before in one of the discussion thread but haven't been able to follow up. The source compatibility section in the proposal is way too vague. I am not sure what happens to existing source code when this type is introduced in the stdlib. For e.g., what happens in SwiftPM itself? If existing source code will break then maybe type should be gated on swift-version 5+.</p>

        <p>I'm OK with <code>get()</code>, but I think that it should be reserved to immediate calls that do not involve any concurrency subtlety. An eventual Future type, for example, should not use <code>get()</code>. A better choice for futures would be <code>wait()</code>.</p>
<p>I say that because I want code reading to quickly tell what is happening. Type inference easily hides the real type of values, and it is important that <code>get()</code> has a consistent meaning (here, a very fast and cheap operation).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I'm disappointed to see <code>get()</code> , as this is probably the first function name with "get" in the standard library, and it's inconsistent with existing naming conventions. If we are going with <code>get()</code> , should the naming conventions be updated to explain when and why a "get" name makes sense?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The only justification I can see is that <code>get</code> will be a term-of-art exception like <code>map</code>. Which is fine.</p>
<p>Note that even the core team justification circles back to contradict its own premise:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[T]he name  <code>unwrapped()</code> [...] seems insufficiently "active" for an operation that is essentially designed to throw as a core part of its operation. [...] That this operation can throw should be apparent enough from the mandatory use of  <code>try</code>  before the call.</p>

        <p>I‘m really confused by this decission, because I don‘t understand the revised Type parameter names. During the second review the most people disliked the enum case names value / error and wanted the previous version of success / failure back while keeping the generic type parameter as they were proposed.</p>
<p>I as a non-native English speaker can tell that this reads now very much akwardly.</p>
<ul>
<li>result success vs. result value</li>
<li>result failure vs. result error (this is kind of “okay“)</li>
</ul>
<p>In pattern matching we now have yet again the same weird situation where the case type is equal to the case name which is redundant. This was exactly the reason most of us wanted success(Value) / failure(Error) but not value(Value) / error(Error) nor success(Success) / failure(Failure).</p>
<p>IMHO Result&lt;Value, Error&gt; is just superior to Result&lt;Success, Failure&gt;.</p>

        <p>But, as the decision text says, you generally won't use those type names unless you are extending <code>Result</code> itself. From my perspective, at least, the main issue was that it would be natural to use <code>let .error(error)</code> and similar in switch statements, which would now naturally be <code>let .failure(error)</code>.</p>

        <p>I read it, but it does not mean that I agree with that decision. Well I guess not everyone can be happy with this. At least we‘re getting the type with an explicit error type parameter.</p>
